# Outgoing Shipping Policy | MSP 

**Please make sure to use the following process when working on creating outgoing shipments for MSP requests.** 1. **Make sure to use the appropriate FedEx account when creating the shipping label. The two accounts we use are GIP (ssetiadi) and TSI (trioptek) and credentials are stored in ITG.** A. **If you do not have access to our FedEx accounts, make sure to ask for someone to make a label for you.** B. **If not sure what account to use, make sure to ask internally for clarification.** 2. **Once logged in, navigate to “Shipping>Create a Shipment”.** 3. **Fill out the shipping information with the most appropriate information available.** A. **When selecting the shipping method make sure to select the most appropriate method to meet any deadlines set in place by the cThe best. The best practice would be to select a method that meets the deadline with at least 1 day to spare.** B. **Under “Billing Details>Your reference” enter the ticket number so billing can reference the shipment with the appropriate ticket. If a ticket does not currently exist then one will need to be created to document the shipment.** 4. **Once the shipping details are filled out, click the “Ship” button at the bottom right corner.** 5. **Print the shipping label and save the shipping receipt.** A. Shipping receipts **can be either saved as a PDF or as a screenshot.** 6. **Place the shipment in the outgoing shipping area in the NOC.** 7. **Fill out the purchase form with the shipping information and attach the shipping receipt.** 8. **Fill out the billable template on the ticket indicating that the purchase form was filled out and indicating the purchase description as “shipping label”.** 9. **Finally, either take the package or arrange for someone to take the package to the closest appropriate drop-off location.**
