### Introduction 

This policy defines the methods and guidelines for internal communication amongst Global IP Networks employees. It is important that authorized communication methods are prioritized and that these guidelines are understood by all organization members. Adhering to this policy helps to streamline internal communication and prevent miscommunication events and breakdowns. This policy also defines which communication methods are to be used in cases of varying priority levels in regards to expected response time. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document:

## 3 Priority levels 

In addition to expected response time, priority should be determined when sending an internal communication. The following priority levels are defined along with the acceptable communication method(s) that should be used for each priority level. A. Low priority (Response is desired within the same business day but not required) a. Email b. Text message c. Instant message B. Medium priority (Response is needed same day) a. Text message b. Instant message C. High priority (Response is needed within 1 hour) a. Text message b. Phone call D. 911 priority (Response is needed immediately) a. Phone call When determining the communication method to use based on the priorities listed above, employees should also factor in whether the communication recipient(s) is on shift. Where multiple communication methods are listed for a priority level and an employee is not sure what method to use, employees should use the faster communication method as defined in the expected response time section above. 

## 4 Company wide communications 

It is crucial that all employees communicate information effectively, especially if it affects others in the organization and or clients. Improper or lack of communication can lead to outages, misinformation, loss of team productivity, loss of revenue, mistrust, and more. Any internal communications that are identified should be shared with management. Management will decide if a notification should go out to the organization to keep everyone informed. This communication should go through the company announcements Slack channel. 

## 5 Additional guidelines and expectations 

If a response is not received within an acceptable amount of time, the next fastest method should be used. For example, if an employee instant messages another employee for a high priority request and no response is received within 1 hour, a phone call communication method needs to be applied. During business hours (salaried staff) or shift hours (hourly staff) employees are expected to be available via all methods of communications defined above.
