### Introduction 

This policy defines the process that needs to be followed when infrastructure installs and reclaims are requested and performed. It is important that this process is followed to ensure the action is properly performed, documented, and billed for. Failure to follow this procedure can result in lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and inaccurate documentation among other issues. 

## 1 Requesting a new install or reclaim 

The infrastructure manager needs to be notified that a new install or reclaim is needed along with the information required to create the ticket. This information should include the client name and what services are being requested (signed proposal) or removed. Once the initial information is filled out, the ticket will be created by the infrastructure manager using the appropriate template and land in the “Installs & Reclaims” department for the infrastructure department to work on. 

## 2 Infrastructure department process 

The infrastructure department will work on the ticket and complete each task. Once a task is completed, it must be documented in the ticket by doing the following: A. Copy all steps in the most recent post and paste as a new comment B. Update the completed steps and information C. Post the comment Once all tasks within the infrastructure team’s scope is completed, the ticket must be transferred to the “I&R QC” department. Install and reclaim requests may only be closed by management. The infrastructure manager may send a ticket back to the infrastructure department if any task needs to be fixed or is incomplete. 

## 3 Management review 

The infrastructure manager will review the ticket to make sure all steps performed by the infrastructure department have been completed correctly. Once verified, the infrastructure manager will notify the billing department to create, update, and or remove all applicable services.
