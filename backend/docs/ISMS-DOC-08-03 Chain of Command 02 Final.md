### Introduction 

This policy sets guidelines for how Global IP Networks utilizes chain of command. This policy improves efficiency and awareness for managers with respect to resource utilization. Additionally, chain of command helps employees understand the communication path that needs to be followed when needing to bring up matters to management and executives. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document: Internal Communication Policy 

## 1 Global IP Networks Organization Chart 

The chain of command path is detailed in the organization chart referenced below. Global IP Networks Organization Chart 

## 2 Chain of command use 

Proper use of chain of command ensures that tasks, projects, and critical communications are properly assigned and or established to employees by their direct managers. Chain of command establishes a path of delegation when regarding different authority levels as defined by the company organization chart above. 

## 3 Exceptions 

In the case that the chain of command path cannot be followed for any reason, each level residing in between the sending and receiving party(s) must be included on all communications. In cases involving sensitive matters, chain of command may be ignored. Generally this results in direct communication with the HR department of the organization.
