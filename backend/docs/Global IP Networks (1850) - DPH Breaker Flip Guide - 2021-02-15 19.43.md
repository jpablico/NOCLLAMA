# At this point the following CRAC units should be off. LIBERT 8 

# (phase 2), CRAC 9 (phase 2), CRAC 10 (power room 1), CRAC 

# 11 (power room 2), CRAC 12 (phase 3), and CRAC 13 (phase 

# 3). You will need to go to each of these and make sure to switch 

# off the lever from on to off.

# Once everything is off (breakers and CRAC units from the steps 

# above), it will be safe to switch the DPH breaker back to on.

# Finally, you will need to power on the CRAC units one at a time. 

# Flip the breaker(s) in correspondence to the first CRAC unit 

# number, then go to that unit's location and switch the unit itself 

# back on. Wait for the unit to fully power on (about 2 minutes 

# each) before moving to the next CRAC unit. Do this until each 

# unit is powered back on, making sure not to power them too fast 

# as to risk tripping the DPH breaker again.
