# Cabinet Provisioning 

## Cross-Connects 

## Phase 1 & 2 

##### Bundled Option 

1. Determine length of cross connect     a. Either with measuring tape or by counting tiles determine the floor length between the two points. Add        an additional 20ft to account for cabinet and rack heights. 

2. Bundle Cables     a. Using black zip ties (if available) carefully bundle the cables with a consistent distant between ties. (If        using more than one cable of the same color, be sure to label before bundling.)           (Example: Bundled cables) 

3. Running Cross Connect     a. Begin at the floor beneath the distros. Pull cables through holes in floor and up cable management, zip        tie them in place near the top most patch panel with two feet of slack. Continue running the bundle to        destination cabinet along the cable try zipping the bundle to the tray every two feet (once a tile.) Pull        the cables tight and flat on the tray.           (Example: How cables should be tied to tray) 


 (Ca bles bunched up and stacked 4” high) (Cables not tied to tray) 

4. Terminating Cross Connect     a. Cap all cables once they have been run.     b. Patch the cables into the distros at the port specified. If no port is specified leave cords zipped to vertical        cable management. 

5. Label Cables     a. At the cabinet end label the cables with the distro, patch panel, and port numbers.        i. Example: P-D1-8.15 (Patch for Dist. 1, Card 8, Port 15)     b. At distro end label cables with the cabinet number.        i. Example: A3-C4 (Aisle 3, Row 4) 

##### Pulling from Box 

1. Running Cross Connect     a. Start from either end and pull the cables from one point to the other.     b. Leave enough slack on the distro side to reach the top of the rack.        c. Leave enough slack on the cabinet end to reach the top of cab, go across the back and half way back down. (Example: Proper length of cross connect inside cabinet) 


 d. Cables need to be run along the tray and zipped tied every two feet. If the cross connect has to be run off the tray for any reason it needs to be bundled. (Example: Each bundle zip tied to tray) (Example: Cables bundled as they leave tray) 

2. Terminating Cross Connect     a. Cap all cables once they have been run.     b. Patch the cables into the distros at the port specified. If no port is specified leave cords zipped to vertical        cable management. 

3. Label Cables     a. At the cabinet end label the cables with the distro, patch panel, and port numbers.        i. Example: P-D1-8.15 (Patch for Dist. 1, Card 8, Port 15)     b. At distro end label cables with the cabinet number.        i. Example: A3-C4 (Aisle 3, Row 4) 


### Phase 3 

##### Pre-Running Cables 

1. Running Cross Connect (There should be NO Ethernet laying on the ground ANY WHERE under the phase 3 floor.) a. From     the patch rack pull the cable along the cable     tray and into the destination cabinet. Run the     cable up one side of cabinet, across the back,     and half way down the other side to ensure the     proper length.        i. If the cabinet is not on the side           with the cable tray be sure to           use the zip tie points under           the tile support bar to secure           the cables to the rail.              (Example: Zip tie points under P3 floor) ii. Leave no less than two feet of slack to hang off of the patch rack side of the wire tray. (Example: Leave at least two feet of slack at the end of cable tray) 


2. Managing and Capping Cross Connect a. After the cable is run, manage the cable inside the cabinet as demonstrated (half cab only.) (Example: Manage cable behind panel as shown) b. Cap the cables on the cabinet side ONLY. c. Leave slack unbundled but rolled up in bottom of cabinet. (Example: Slack in bottom of full cab) (Example: Slack in bottom of half cab) 

3. Labeling Cross Connect     a. Label the cross connect with the cabinet number on both sides 

##### When Provisioning Request Comes In 

1. Terminating the Cross Connect     a. Once the cabinet order has come in we will cut off the extra slack and terminate the cables to        the first available port on the patch rack. 

2. Managing the Cross Connect     a. Manage the cables like the cables that are already in place. 


 (Example: Management and spacing for patch rack cables) 

3. Labeling the Cross Connect     a. Now that the slack has been cut off, the patch rack side of the cross connect will need to be        labeled again with the cabinet number (make sure label is facing up.)     b. The cabinet side will be labeled with the patch rack info.        Example: PR1-P1 (Patch Rack 1, Primary Panel, Port 1)        Example: PR1 S1 (Patch Rack 1, Secondary Panel, Port 1) 

4. Running Patch to Distro Cables     a. Make a cable in the proper color from the netcage patch port that corresponds to the patch rack        port number to the next available distro port.           i. Be very conscious of the length of the cable so we don’t end up with lots of extra slack. 

5. Managing Patch to Distro Cables     a. Manage the cables following the existing scheme. Manage slack out of site inside cable        management. 


#### . 

(Example: Cable slack) (Example: P3 patch panel wire management) (Example: P3 distro wire management) 

6. Labeling Patch to Distro Cables a. The distro end should display the patch panel info. The patch end should display the distro info. Example: PP1- 4 (Primary Patch 1, Port 4) Example: D11-1.47 (Dist. 11, Card 1, Port 47) (Example: P3 distro labeling) (Example: P3 patch panel labeling) 

7. Testing Cross Connect     a. Test the entire cross Connect from distro to cabinet with the cable tester. 

## Additional Notes: 

#####  When capping, be sure the jacket goes as far into the cap as possible. 

#####  The safety barricade MUST be used ANYTIME you need to work under the floor. 

 (See “Safety Barricade Use” Document for more details.) 


#####  Below are the sizes for some common labels for provisioning; 

##### -Cable labels: size small, half width 

##### -Cabinet labels: size medium, normal width 

##### -PDU Labels: Usually size small, normal width (Depends on PDU) 

##### -PDU plug labels: size small, half width 

#####  There should be NO Ethernet on the ground under the Phase 3 floor. 

All cables should be in the cable tray or zip tied near the top of the floor support legs.
