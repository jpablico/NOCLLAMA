# Policy & Procedure Service Provider Technician Check-In 

1. Properly identify the technician(s) onsite that they are with a service provider or a 3rd-     party contractor, either through a badge/company identification or any paperwork or     documentation they may have that proves they are an employee with the company they     are representing. 

2. Check-in the technician(s) in as a vendor. If they are with Cogent or Logix, check them in     as a customer and ensure they are on the access-list.     **Cogent** : Cage B4 & Cage N2 Rack N12     **Crown Castle** (previous FPL FiberNet & FiberDirect): Cage N2 Rack N12     **Logix** : A14-C3     **Spectrum** : Cage N1 Rack N2 & B7-C17 (Enterprise), Demarc Cage (Business Class,     coax)     **FiberLight** : Cage N1 Rack N2     **AT&T** : Cage N1 Rack N2 (Enterprise), Demarc Cage (POTS)     **Frontier** : Cage N1 Rack N1 (Verizon gear), Demarc Cage (POTS & T1 circuits)     **Lumen/CenturyLink** : Cage N1 Rack N6 & Rack N1 (legacy TW Telecom gear)     **Zayo** : Cage N1 Rack N1     Cage N1 Rack N3, N4, N5 & Cage N2 Rack N9, N10, N11 are **GIPN ONLY!**     During the check-in process with the technician(s), please let them know that they will     need to fill out a form regarding the work they are doing for documentation and audit     purposes. 

3. Right after checking the technician in, unlock the iPad that is in the NOC, open a web-     browser and visit the following page: https://forms.gle/NXHVxM4CKNfmfrJX9     It may be best to simply bookmark this link on the iPad ahead of time. 

4. Login with your G-Suite account to unlock access to the form. 

5. Hand the iPad to the technician and have them fill out the form. If thereâ€™s more than one     technician both working on the same task, only one of them needs to fill the form out. 

6. Once the form has been filled out and submitted, simply review the ticket that was     received from the form, and if everything appears well (such as no fake information or     missing data), simply close the ticket. 

7. Proceed with checking out the technician(s). Lock up the cabinets and cages     immediately.     Any questions that may come up with this process & procedure, please contact Jordan,     and if unavailable, contact your nearest manager.
