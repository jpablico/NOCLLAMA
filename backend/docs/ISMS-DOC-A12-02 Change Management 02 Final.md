### Introduction 

The purpose of this document is to set out the Global IP Networks process of change management. The objective of this process is to ensure that changes to IT services and their associated components are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner. A change request may arise for many reasons, including but not limited to the following: A. An incident or problem B. New hardware installation C. New or changed functionality D. IT Infrastructure upgrades E. New or changed legislation F. Changed business requirements or direction G. Retirement of service A change request must be assessed for impact (including information security implications) and resource requirements before being considered by the Change Advisory Board (CAB). To assist with impact assessment, the identification of related systems/components affected by the proposed change and input from other affected support groups may be required. After assessment, if the change is deemed acceptable it will be authorised by the CAB. Once implemented the change will be reviewed and subject to the findings of the review, closed. This document should be read in conjunction with the following documents: Secure Development Policy Information Classification Procedure Change Management Procedure Moratorium Document 


 ISMS-DOC-A12-02 Change Management 02 Final 

## 1 Categories of change 

The following categories of change will be used: A. Standard B. Normal C. Emergency D. Major Each of these categories will require different processing as follows: 

### 1.1 Standard changes 

Standard changes are no-risk changes that do not need approval and so do not need to follow the full review and approval process. Standard changes will still be recorded in the service desk system and the implementation process of each standard change will be fully documented. 

### 1.2 Normal changes 

These are “business as usual” changes which are expected to make up most of the change requests that are logged and handled through the change management process as described in this document. Although not emergencies, they will be prioritised in order that resources can be allocated in as effective a manner as possible. To provide a framework for classification purposes, these are changes that are low risk of bringing a system down. Anything that has a higher risk of bringing a system down is NOT a normal change. 

### 1.3 Emergency changes 

Whilst all changes likely to be required should be foreseen and planned, there will be occasions when business requirements demand that changes be made in an emergency situation (different from urgent). Such changes are those requests which impact on internal or external ‘live’ systems and require implementation in order to resolve (or prevent) a current high priority incident or problem. In such cases a change request must be raised immediately even if the full change details are not available and the CAB, ECAB, and IT Steering Group must be notified. This is to ensure that all parties are aware at the earliest opportunity. From initial logging of the change, the principles of the normal change management process should be observed as far as is realistic, however, as an emergency change may require swift approval from the CAB an Emergency CAB (E-CAB) meeting may be held. 


ISMS-DOC-A12-02 Change Management 02 Final If an emergency change cannot be formally authorised after reasonable efforts have been made to follow the process (e.g. out of hours) a local decision may be made as to whether this change will be implemented. However, details of the change must still be recorded, and the change management process followed retrospectively to ensure that records are maintained accurately and the success or failure of the change can be reviewed. Where timescales allow it, the CAB in collaboration with the relevant support groups will ensure the following: A. Sufficient staff and resources are available to action and support the change request B. Back-out plans have been documented and passed to the change Implementer C. As much testing as possible of the emergency change has been completed When an emergency change request is logged the CAB will do the following: D. Assess who should form the Emergency Change Advisory Board (E-CAB) E. Communicate with each member of the E-CAB by whatever means is appropriate (face-to-face, telephone, email) to obtain a combined impact assessment The remainder of the process will then continue but under the guidance of the E-CAB rather than the scheduled CAB i.e. as quickly as possible whilst retaining control and managing risk Changes processed as emergencies will be reviewed by the CAB on a regular basis to ensure that they are genuine emergencies and do not arise from a lack of forward planning. 

### 1.4 Major changes 

Major changes will be logged within the change management process but referred to the IT Steering Group as their scope and implications will generally encompass a wider audience. They will then be raised as projects with their own business case, project team and budget. However, note that a project may generate further change requests that may be managed within the change management process as normal changes. To provide a framework for classification purposes, these are changes that are medium to high risk of bringing a system down.

### 2.2 Process narrative 

##### The following steps are carried out in the change management process. 

###### STEP ROLE DESCRIPTION 

Raise change request Change Initiator Create a change record within the service desk system detailing all the required information. Classify and assess change request by CAB or E-CAB Change Advisory Board/ Emergency Change Advisory Board Assess and assign change request category. The change request needs to be checked that all the required information has been entered. The change should be rejected if it is: 

- Totally impractical 

- A duplicate change request 

- Incomplete Assess a Major change request for technical and business risk Change Advisory Board The implications of the proposed change are assessed from a business and a technical point of view. This should include the timing and impact on information security, capacity, service continuity plans and release management, amongst other areas. For changes being classified as major a MOP and backout plan needs to be supplied by the implementer. Assess a Normal change request for technical and business risk Change Advisory Board The implications of the proposed change are assessed from a business and a technical point of view. This should include the timing and impact on information security, capacity, service continuity plans and release management, amongst other areas. Assess an Emergency change request for technical and business risk Change Advisory Board/ Emergency Change Advisory Board The change is assessed as for a Normal change but in an accelerated time scale either face to face or via telephone, email etc. 


ISMS-DOC-A12-02 Change Management 02 Final STEP ROLE DESCRIPTION Refer to IT Steering Group Change Advisory Board If the change is categorised as Major, then it will be referred to the IT Steering Group as a possible project. Approve or reject the change request Change Advisory Board/ Emergency Change Advisory Board Approve if OK, reject if not. Refer back to change initiator if more information required. Internal requests that are classified as major changes cannot be approved under any moratorium period. Amend change request Change Initiator The addition of further information if required or clarification of existing information. Inform Initiator and Implementer Change Advisory Board/ Emergency Change Advisory Board Once the change has been approved, the initiator and implementer need to be notified to coordinate the scheduling and implementation process. Implement Change Request Change Implementer Make the change on the date and time scheduled. Test to ensure it has worked successfully. Change status to successful Change Advisory Board Mark the change record with a status of successful. Change status Failed Change Advisory Board Mark the change record with a status of failed. For major changes the IT Steering Group needs to be notified of change failure. Implement Backout Plan Change Implementer Remove the change if unsuccessful by following the backout plan. Review Change Request Change Advisory Board Review the change records to ensure that no related incidents or problems have arisen since the change was made. Close Change Request Change Advisory Board Once a final review of the change request has been completed, the change request case can be closed. _Table 1: Change management process narrative_

## 3 Change advisory board 

### 3.1 CAB meetings 

The volume and classification of changes will be reviewed and discussed amongst the CAB on demand after a change request has been made. The general principle is that all relevant parties are consulted regarding a change that may affect them and these parties may be different according to the scope of a specific change. Therefore, a process of approval via email or telephone may be used in advance of a full CAB meeting if the timescale of the change requires a decision before the next meeting. The relevant parties for the approval of a change will usually consist of the following as necessary: A. Service Provider B. IT Steering Group C. Initiator 


 ISMS-DOC-A12-02 Change Management 02 Final D. Implementer E. E-CAB F. Supplier 

### 3.2 Changes notified by cloud service providers 

Changes notified to Global IP Networks by cloud service providers (CSPs) will be assessed as part of CAB meetings in order to understand and plan for the impact of these changes on the change schedule and on the organization as a whole. Where appropriate, further information about upcoming changes should be requested from the CSP to allow an accurate impact assessment to be made. 

## 4 Reporting 

### 4.1 Change schedule 

The CAB is responsible for issuing the change schedule on a weekly basis. This will set out details of the changes to be implemented in the next few months. The following information will be included: A. Date and time of implementation B. Change number C. Change description D. Systems and users impacted E. Expected duration of change It is anticipated that this information will also be made available for internal staff. Changes by our organization, or by a supplier that provides supporting services, that affect cloud service customers will be notified to cloud service customer administrators as early as possible to give the customer adequate time to prepare for any required service outages. The above information will be provided. 

### 4.2 Reports for CAB 

The following reports will be produced by the CAB on a regular basis and reviewed as part of the CAB meetings in order to identify trends and possible process improvements: A. Number of changes raised and closed by week/month B. Breakdown of categories of change requests raised i.e. Normal, Emergency and Major C. Average time to process a change request of each category D. Percentage successful change requests E. Sources of change requests e.g. business area 


ISMS-DOC-A12-02 Change Management 02 Final F. Types of change requests e.g. server, network or by business application Requirements for further reports will be reviewed on a regular basis. Identified improvements will be input to the continual improvement plan.
