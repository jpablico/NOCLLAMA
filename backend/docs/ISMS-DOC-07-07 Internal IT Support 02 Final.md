### Introduction 

This policy describes the overall approach that all Global IP Networks staff takes for internal IT requests. All requests are to be made using the IT ticketing system to ensure they are properly documented and processed. Any requests that are made outside the IT ticketing system must be rerouted to the IT ticketing system before any other action is taken by the internal IT department. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document: Policy | Employee Onboarding/ Offboarding 

## 1 Scope 

Internal IT request can consist of, but are not limited to, the following: A. Access changes/ requests to internal systems B. Password resets C. Issues with IT hardware/ software D. Access and hardware requests related to employee onboarding and offboarding E. New IT hardware/ software purchase requests F. Loss of IT hardware 

## 2 Contact method 

There are a few ways to create a ticket in the IT ticketing system. A. An email with request details can be sent to support@gipinternal.zendesk.com B. A ticket can be created from within the IT ticketing system a. If using this method, the “Brand” field of the ticket must be changed to “Global IP Networks Internal Helpdesk” C. If none of the above methods can be used, employees may request their direct manager to create the request on their behalf If one of the above methods are used, employees should expect a response by the internal IT department within 24 hours. If no response is received after 24 hours, employees should notify their direct manager for escalation. Please note, if the above methods are not used, the internal IT department may not receive requests properly. This may result in delays.

## 3 Emergencies and escalations 

If a request is needing to be classified as an emergency or escalated, employees are to reach out to their direct managers. If the need is determined justifiable by management, then management should reach out directly to the internal IT department via phone call or direct message to request the ticket to be labelled as emergency or escalated. The following conditions may be applied to support tickets by management. A. Emergency request a. A new or existing request needing immediate attention and resolution b. Highest priority level B. Escalated request a. A new or existing request needing increased attention or resolution speed b. Second highest priority level
