# Optic Fiber 

Fiber comes in a few industry standard forms Single Mode (SM) Multimode (MM) andWide Band Multimode Fiber (WBMMF). There is a Universal Color code for Multi-strand Fiber Similar to the Standard Copper Cable layout When Looking at a Fiber Enclosure read the Cassettes/Bulkheads from left to right alphabetically skipping the letter I. Example this enclosure has 12 Bulkheads so they read in order A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,J,K,L,M 

# Single Mode 

Single Mode Fiber Primarily comes in one color Yellow or Occasionally you’ll find the jumpers to be Dark Blue Core Assets/Documentation/Knowledge Base/Fiber 1 


Single Mode connectors can come in 2 colors the standard Dark blue above or it can change to an APC connector (angled connector) which comes in a Dark green. Core Assets/Documentation/Knowledge Base/Fiber 2 


The Difference between UPC and APC is shown here The difference between OS1 and OS2 fiber optic cables is mainly in cable construction rather than optical fiber specifications. OS1 type cable is predominantly of a tight buffered construction whereas OS2 is a loose tube or blown cable construction where the cable design applies less stress on the optical fibers. OS1 fiber optic cable is designed for premises where the maximum distance is 2,000 meters with transmission speeds of 1 to 10 gigabit Ethernet. OS2 fiber optic cable is designed for larger transmission distances in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 meters with similar transmission speed of 1 to 10 gigabit Ethernet. In Table 3 attenuation specifications of OS1 and OS2 fiber optic cables as mentioned in ISO/IEC and EN standards are summarized 

## Multimode 

Multimode Fiber Primarily comes in Aqua for OM3 and OM4 and Orange for OM1 and OM2. Core Assets/Documentation/Knowledge Base/Fiber 3 


Conventional 62.5/125 μm (OM1) and 50/125 μm (OM2) multi-mode cables were widely deployed in premises applications for many years. These cables were ideal for use with LED transmitters and support applications ranging from Ethernet (10 Mbit/s) to Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbit/s). Later as users required higher speed networks, laser-optimized 50/125 μm OM3 & OM4 cables were deployed that provide bandwidth to support transmission above 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Laser optimized multi-mode (LOMMF) cable OM3 & OM4 are designed for use with 850 nm VCSELs that are capable of modulation over 10 Gbit/s whereas LEDs have a maximum modulation rate of 622 Mbit/s. OM cables are often characterized in terms of their modal bandwidth. OM1 & OM2 light sources typically exceed the numerical aperture of the fiber and so the modal bandwidth values are commonly known as 'overfilled launch'. OM3 & OM4 require restricted launch conditions provided by lasers/VCSELs to achieve high modal bandwidths in addition to 'overfilled launch'. Table 1 shows bandwidth and attenuation values of different types of OM cables. A guide to typical transmission distances for each category of OM cables are shown in table 2. It should be remembered that the actual reach for a given bandwidth depends upon the network design and chosen engineering hardware solution. The choice of cable is therefore part of a solution package and needs to be specified by the network designer. 

# Wide Band Multimode Fiber 

WBMMF is OM5 MM fiber that is Lime Green. It’s Fairly new and we most likely will not be using it in the Data Center. Core Assets/Documentation/Knowledge Base/Fiber 4 


# SM VS MM 

The main difference between OM and OS type cables is in core diameter with OM multimode fibers having a much larger core size. Two types of OM cables with core diameters of 50 micron and 62.5 micron are specified. The large core gives OM cables a higher "light-gathering" capacity compared to OS cables. In practical terms, the larger core size simplifies connections and allows the use of lower-cost light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and vertical-cavity surfaceemitting lasers (VCSELs) operating at 850 nm and 1300 nm. OS cables used in telecommunications operate mainly at 1310 or 1550 nm wavelengths and require more expensive laser sources. Compared to OS cables, the –bandwidth distance product (represented as Mhz.km) of OM fibers is low because the larger core-size supports more than one propagation mode; hence it is limited by modal dispersion. The LED light sources also contain a wide range of wavelengths that propagate at different speeds and produce chromatic dispersion, which is another limit to the useful length for OM type fiber optic cable. In contrast, the lasers used to drive single-mode fibers produce coherent light of a single or narrower wavelength range. Light propagation between single mode and multimode fibers differs. Multimode fiber obtains two types — step index and grade index. Single mode fiber has one type — step index. The light propagation during signal transmission in a single mode fiber reduces less than that of multimode fibers. Core Assets/Documentation/Knowledge Base/Fiber 5 


Even though the cost of a single mode fiber cable is cheaper than that of a multimode fiber cable, single mode fiber cable systems are typically more expensive. The reason being single mode fiber requires a transceiver that has a laser with a smaller spot-size and narrower spectral width, allowing it to function at a longer wavelength. In addition, the alignment between two fibers and the tolerances between two connectors has to be more precise. The end result is a higher cost for single mode fiber interconnects.

Distance is the most important thing to consider when deciding to use single mode or multimode fiber. It’s typical to install multimode fibers from 300 meters to 400 meters within a data center. Single Mode fiber can run from 10 kilometers (10km) to 80 kilometers (80km), and even farther. Installers must use the proper optics for the distance required. Multimode is a better choice for transmission distances up to 550 meters in data center applications and less expensive. For distances above 550 meters, single mode fiber is best. Besides the distance, the total cost of ownership (TCO) should also be taken into consideration. Most importantly, choosing the right fiber for the network is the intelligent choice.
