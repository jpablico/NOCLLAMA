## Introduction 

This policy details how Global IP Networks employees are to record and classify time in the ticketing system. Time is required to be recorded and classified for multiple purposes including billing, reporting, time budgeting, etc. This policy will also introduce and define the categories that are to be used when classifying time recording entries. Proper assignment of these categories is critical as they determine how the time is processed. 

## 1 Scope 

This policy applies to all support tickets worked by the iOps department. Time is recorded differently by the infrastructure department and this policy does not apply to those tickets. When in doubt, employees are to ask their direct manager for clarification. 

## 2 Billable categories and definitions 

The following categories are to be applied to time recorded in each support ticket that applies to the scope above: 

- Support 

- Tickets labelled under the support billable category are tickets initiated by     the client to perform actions and involve interacting with the client directly.     This will likely be the majority of tickets and involve requests that fall under     the clients scope of support/ support agreement. 

- Out of Scope Support 

- Tickets labelled under this category indicate time that is billable for services     outside a client’s support agreement. For example, if a support agreement     only covers servers and the client wants a staff member to troubleshoot     their workstation, this would be considered out of scope support. 

- Infrastructure/ Administration 

- Tickets labelled under the infrastructure/ administration billable category     are tickets initiated by Global IP Networks or clients to perform actions/     management on a client’s infrastructure or services. This would involve     actions such as performing maintenance on a client’s server, firewall/VPN     configuration changes, renewing a client’s domain, modifying a Site 24x7     threshold, resolving alerts, user management, etc. This also includes     administration of O365, Google Workspaces, and active directory. 

- Internal 

- Tickets labelled under this category will include tasks that are not related to     any client request. These tickets are used to track internal tasks that are     being performed. 


 ISMS-DOC-07-08 Billable Category 02 Final 

- Project (hourly) 

- Tickets labelled under the project (hourly) billable category are tickets to     track and perform tasks related to a pre approved project that has     indicated an hourly rate for labor. These projects will usually have set     scopes and tasks that will be classified beforehand. 

- Project (non hourly) 

- Tickets labelled under the project (non hourly) billable category are tickets     to track and perform tasks related to a pre approved project that has     indicated an included cost for labor. These projects will usually have set     scopes and tasks that will be classified beforehand. 

- Proposal 

- Note that this category is a legacy category and is not to be used for any     reason. It currently exists to preserve the data structure of legacy data. 

- On Site 

- Tickets labelled under the on site billable category are tickets that are     related to tasks performed by GIP staff while at a client’s site per a     predefined agreement with the client. This is not to be confused with a one     time request to go on site to resolve an issue (which would fall under the     “Support” category in most cases). 

## 3 Special notes for support category 

Time recorded under the support category should take into account how much time was spent directly working on resolving each request. Time spent researching a resolution or performing testing should not be recorded in the ticket. The following clarifications are presented to help further clarify how time is to be recorded under this category: Time that should be recorded as it relates to support: 

- 30 minutes spent logging in with an end user and applying a fix 

- 15 minutes spent updating Quickbooks on a server 

- 5 minutes spent remoting into an end user’s computer to observe their issue 

- Note that this time is applicable and should not be confused with the time     spent afterwards researching a solution. 

- 2 hours spent on a conference call initiated by the client with the client’s vendor Time that should not be recorded as it relates to support: 

- 1 hour spent researching solutions for an issue 

- 2 hours spent on a conference call initiated by GIP with a client’s vendor (not     related to a pre approved project) 

- 30 minutes spent testing a solution found on a web search to see if it works If any further clarification is needed for a particular request, employees should reach out to their direct manager. 


 ISMS-DOC-07-08 Billable Category 02 Final 

## 4 Requests that consist of multiple billable 

## categories 

It is expected that a request may grow to consist of tasks that can be recorded under multiple categories. In these cases a best effort is to be made by Global IP Networks employees to separate these tasks into a separate ticket, as only one billable category can be applied at a time to a ticket. If this cannot be done or introduces complications that may affect client satisfaction, a separate ticket is to be created for the sole purpose of recording time for each applicable billable category. IMPORTANT NOTE: Any additional ticket created for this purpose needs to be assigned the appropriate client in order to be processed correctly.
