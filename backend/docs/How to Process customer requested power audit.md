How to process power audit request from customers 

1. Use a duplicate of the power audit template document 

2. Rename the file to “Power audit | [Company Name] 

3. Date 

4. Company Name 

5. KW calculation: Add all of the amperage readings of the voltages that are     the same (e.g. 120v or 208v) and multiply by that voltage. That number     should now be dived by 1000 and that’s the KW. For customers with     cabinets with different voltages, once the total of both KW of each of the     voltages is obtained just add the KW together. That would be the total KW. 

6. Attach the actual readings to the document from an excel spreadsheet 

7. Save the document into a PDF 

8. Send Power Audit document via a ticket. 

9. Any questions, please reach out to Charles, Jordan or Jared V. Thanks.
