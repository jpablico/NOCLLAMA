## Policy and Procedure HIPAA 

### What is HIPAA? 

HIPAA is the acronym of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, created primarily to modernize the flow of healthcare information, stipulate how Personally Identifiable Information (Phi or ePhi) maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and address limitations on healthcare insurance coverage. Phi or ePhi means electronic protected health information, or the data itself. **The goals of HIPAA are to protect health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs (Portability) and to protect health data integrity, confidentiality, and availability (Accountability).** 

### How to Assist HIPAA Customers? 

**For Data Center Customer:** In most cases, since we do not manage their environment, we can do very little to support data center customers due to the highly restricted exposure and the liability of ePhi. What we can do is limited to the outside scope only: 

- Device reboot **Since the following may lead to the exposure of ePhi, these are not allowed:** 

- Setting up KVM/IP 

- Logging into the ePhi server physically or remotely 

- Logging into the switch or router connected directly to customer’s servers 

- Hard drive removal (unless accompanied by the proper chain of custody) 

- Storing customer server without the proper chain of custody If customer requested us to do the tasks that are not allowed above, gently notify and refuse with this answer or similar: Dear <customer>, To comply with HIPAA regulations and to further protect your data integrity and confidentiality, we are unable to perform the task you requested. We apologize for this inconvenience. However, we can provide assistance that does not require access to your system (i.e. router, switches and servers) such as physically rebooting the device via power button. Please let us know if we can assist you further in this matter. Thank you, For hard drives or server removal, please use the chain of custody form located in KB (All Team) > Form - GIPN HIPAA Chain of Custody
