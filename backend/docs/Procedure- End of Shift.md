# Policies and Procedures 

## End-of-Shift 

- End-of-Shifts are to be performed by each shift the hour before the shift is over. 

- Exactly how these are divided up on a weekly or ongoing basis is determined by the shift supervisor or the most senior employee on a shift without a supervisor. 

- End-of shift is not a valid reason for overtime. Employees are expected to plan ahead and leave time in their day for this job responsibility. 

## Tasks to perform during End-of-Shifts are; 

1. A physical check (button push) of each cabinet in each row of all datacenters. 

2. Check and empty all trash cans in building if over 50% full.     a. This includes datacenters, breakrooms, conference rooms, waiting areas, business        continuity, and NOC.     b. Private offices and restrooms are not part of this check but may be requested as        required. 

3. Check that all common areas are tidy. (restrooms, breakrooms, conference rooms, BC, hallways,     datacenters.) This includes but is not limited to;        a. All chairs in business continuity are pushed under desks.        b. All crash carts, tables and chairs in datacenters are return to where they belong.        c. Smudges and handprints cleaned from all cabinets and conference tables.        d. Vestibule, lobby, and customer breakroom are clean and clear of debris. 

4. Check all static mats, landings, and ramps at datacenter doors. Replace and clean as needed. 

5. Check that all breakrooms and fridges are stocked with soda, water, eating utensils, paper     products, coffee and coffee paraphernalia.

## What to do if you find a problem
