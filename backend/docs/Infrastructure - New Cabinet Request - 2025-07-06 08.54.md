# New Cabinet Request 

# Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to define the procedure for new cabinet requests from the initial request all the way to billing. 

# Scope 

This SOP is meant for Management, NOC staff and Billing when a new cabinet request is made for Dallas or Plano datacenters. **Request Initiation:** A New Cabinet Request can be initiated either by Management or by the Customer. If the request is from the customer, it will be made through an Ubersmith ticket/Email. If it's from the management, the request will be communicated internally. 

### 1. 

2. **Initial Review:** If the request comes from management, go to step 3. If the request is from a customer, proceed to step 4.     **Management Request Handling** :        Evaluate the request based on the company's current capacity and resource availability.        Determine the specifications for the new cabinet, including power, space, and network needs.        Proceed to step 5. 

### 3. 

 1. Customer Request Handling : Review the Ubersmith ticket to understand the customer's needs. Engage the customer to clarify the details of their requirements. This should include specifics about power needs (e.g., voltage, redundancy), space needs (number of units), and network needs (bandwidth, connection type). Once the details are clarified, update the customer with pricing for their specific needs. Proceed to step 5.
