### Introduction 

This documentâ€™s purpose is to detail the policy that is to be followed regarding tracking time utilization. All time worked needs to be documented and categorized in order for management to gather data needed for business tasks such as utilization analysis and forecasting. It is important to accurately track your time in order for your efforts to be properly documented. Please note this does not affect any current time tracking efforts used for billing purposes. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document

Time will be tracked using the Clockify web application. Staff members identified in the distribution section above will have individual logins for access. It is highly encouraged to use the Clockify web extension in order to track time easier across multiple sites and or tools. When tracking time, prebuilt categories will be in place and must be used. In case of error, time entries can also be edited accordingly.

## 3 Time Tracking Client 

The client will need to be selected that best matches the task that is being worked on. This will help better categorize the time that is being recorded in the system. Note that this is an internal client selection as the two choices are as follows: 

- Global IP Networks 

- CloudKey 

## 4 PTO and Time Off 

PTO and or approved time off is to be tracked using the Clockify application. This is to be used in order for time utilization reports to be more accurate and to not account for time that could not normally be reported. 

## 5 Utilization Reports 

Management will be expected to produce regular utilization reports for analysis and review. These reports are to be reviewed for accuracy before being distributed accordingly.
