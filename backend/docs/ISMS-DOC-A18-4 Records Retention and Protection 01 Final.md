### Introduction 

#### In its everyday business operations Global IP Networks collects and stores records of 

#### many types and in a variety of different formats. The relative importance and sensitivity of 

#### these records also varies and is subject to the organization’s security classification scheme 

#### (see Information Classification Procedure). 

#### It is important that these records are protected from loss, destruction, falsification, 

#### unauthorized access and unauthorized release and a range of controls are used to ensure 

#### this, including backups, access control and encryption. 

#### Global IP Networks also has a responsibility to ensure that it complies with all relevant 

#### legal, regulatory and contractual requirements in the collection, storage, retrieval and 

#### destruction of records. 

#### This control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization’s 

#### information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other 

#### third parties who have access to Global IP Networks systems. 

#### The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document: 

#### Information Asset Inventory 

#### Information Classification Procedure 

#### Information Labelling Procedure 

#### Procedure for the Management of Removable Media 

## 1 Records retention and protection policy 

#### This policy begins by establishing the main principles that must be adopted when 

#### considering record retention and protection. It then sets out the types of records held by 

#### Global IP Networks and their general requirements before discussing record protection, 

#### destruction and management. 

### 1.1 General principles 

#### There are several key general principles that must be adopted when considering record 

#### retention and protection policy. These are: 

#### A. Records must be held in compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory and 

#### contractual requirements 

#### B. Records must not be held for any longer than required 

#### C. The protection of records in terms of their confidentiality, integrity and availability 

#### must be in accordance with their security classification 

#### D. Records must always remain retrievable in line with business requirements 

#### A summary of the specific requirements of the relevant data protection laws can be found 

#### in Legal, Regulatory and Contractual Requirements.

### 1.2 Record types and guidelines 

#### In order to assist with the definition of guidelines for record retention and protection, 

#### records held by Global IP Networks are grouped into the categories listed in the table on 

#### the following page. For each of these categories, the required or recommended retention 

#### period and allowable storage media are also given, together with a reason for the 

#### recommendation or requirement. 

#### Note that these are guidelines only and there may be specific circumstances where 

#### records need to be kept for a longer or shorter period of time. This should be decided on a 

#### case by case basis as part of the design of the information security elements of new or 

#### significantly changed processes and services. 

#### Further information about records held by the organization, including their security 

#### classifications and owners can be found in Information Asset Inventory.

### 1.3 Use of cryptography 

#### Where appropriate to the classification of information and the storage medium, 

#### cryptographic techniques may be used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of 

#### records. 

#### Care must be taken to ensure that encryption keys used to encrypt records are securely 

#### stored for the life of the relevant records and comply with the organization’s policy on 

#### cryptography (see Cryptographic Policy ). 

### 1.4 Media selection 

#### The choice of long-term storage media must take into account the physical 

#### characteristics of the medium and the length of time it will be in use. 

#### Where records are legally (or practically) required to be stored on paper, adequate 

#### precautions must be taken to ensure that environmental conditions remain suitable for 

#### the type of paper used. Where possible, backup copies of such records may be taken by 

#### methods such as scanning. Regular checks must be made to assess the rate of 

#### deterioration of the paper and action taken to preserve the records if required. 

#### For records stored on electronic media such as tape, similar precautions must be taken to 

#### ensure the longevity of the materials, including correct storage and copying onto more 

#### robust media if necessary. The ability to read the contents of the particular tape (or other 

#### similar media) format must be maintained by the keeping of a device capable of 

#### processing it. If this is impractical an external third party may be employed to convert the 

#### media onto an alternative format. 

### 1.5 Record retrieval 

#### There is little point in retaining records if they are not able to be accessed in line with 

#### business or legal requirements. The choice and maintenance of record storage facilities 

#### must ensure that records can be retrieved in a usable format within an acceptable period 

#### of time. An appropriate balance should be struck between the cost of storage and the 

#### speed of retrieval so that the most likely circumstances are adequately catered for.

### 1.6 Record destruction 

#### Once records have reached the end of their life according to the defined policy, they must 

#### be securely destroyed in a manner that ensures that they can no longer be used in line 

#### with Procedure for the Management of Removable Media. 

#### This procedure allows for the correct recording of the details of disposal which must be 

#### retained as evidence. 

### 1.7 Record review 

#### The retention and storage of records must be subject to a regular review process carried 

#### out under the guidance of management to ensure that: 

#### A. The policy on records retention and protection remains valid 

#### B. Records are being retained according to the policy 

#### C. Records are being securely disposed of when no longer required 

#### D. Legal, regulatory and contractual requirements are being fulfilled 

#### E. Processes for record retrieval are meeting business requirements 

#### The results of these reviews must be recorded.
