Alternatively, in cases where a USB is not required, we can provide a CD or DVD at no charge. You are also welcome to mail us your own flash drive or external HDD if you wish. 

  These flash drives will be placed in the NOC for employees to access. Please make sure that any ticket where a customer uses one of these is sent to billing even if there is no time added.  GIP employees should not use the 16GB USB 3.0 flash drives. Other drives will continue to be available for internal use.
