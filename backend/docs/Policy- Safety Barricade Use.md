# Policies and Procedures 

## Safety Barricade Use 

For liability reasons it is imperative that GIP Networks, its employees, vendors, and contractors use safety barricades to mark a safe perimeter around any work being done while the raised floor is open. 

  The area of raised floor open at one time should be limited to the minimum suitable for that job.  GIP Network’s employees MUST enforce this policy on all who have access to the raised floor.  Safety barricades are located in Phase 1 next to PDU D and are to be returned there after use. 

 Adherence to this policy will allow GIP Networks to provide a safe and productive environment for its customers, visitors, and employees.
