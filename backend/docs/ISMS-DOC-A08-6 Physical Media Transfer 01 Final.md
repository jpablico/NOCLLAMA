## Introduction 

#### There are occasions when Global IP Networks needs to share sensitive information with 

other parties. This may be for a variety of purposes including day to day commercial arrangements, software development, software testing, merger and acquisition projects and joint ventures. Under such circumstances it is important that the method by which information is transferred is understood and documented and that all parties involved are fully aware of the precautions that must be taken to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. This procedure sets out the methods by which an appropriately secure physical media transfer will take place. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document: _Information Classification Procedure Information Labeling Procedure Asset Handling Procedure Procedure for the Management of Removable Media_ 

## 1 Physical media transfer procedure 

Physical media (excluding the information contained within) may be transferred from one location to another. These transfers vary from internal Global IP Networks sites or third party sites. The information contained within the physical media will either be encrypted or structured in such a way that unauthorized extraction is rendered useless. 

### 1.1 Information to be transferred 

This procedure describes the steps involved in performing the following media transfer: INFORMATION TO BE TRANSFERRED The purpose will be to transfer the physical media, not the information contained INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION Restricted TRANSFEROR [Name of Transferor organization] RECIPIENT [Name of Recipient organization] PURPOSE OF TRANSFER Repurpose resources, assets FREQUENCY OF TRANSFER As needed MAIN TRANSFER METHOD Physical transfer via courier TRANSFER AGREEMENT NUMBER Ticket #

### 1.2 Triggering the procedure 

This procedure will begin upon the Sender being provided with the packaged physical media by the information producers. Due to the sensitive nature of the information, the media will be encrypted using standard encryption methods specified by the organization. This may involve the use of a pre-shared key between the Sender and the Receiver. The physical media will be packaged using bubble wrap and a padded envelope. The address of the Receiver will be written on the outside of the package and checked by more than one person. 

### 1.3 Notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt 

When a package is ready to be sent, the Sender will inform the Receiver via an internal support ticket at the following address: support@gipnetworks.com The Receiver will confirm via the internal support ticket that they are aware that a package is being sent. 

### 1.4 Use of couriers 

Only couriers on the approved list will be used to transfer the information. Under no circumstances should other couriers be used. The sender will give the package to the authorized courier personally. The level of service for the delivery and the tracking information should be confirmed with the courier as part of the handover and recorded in the internal support ticket. 

### 1.5 Chain of custody 

Where available the package should also be tracked electronically by both parties (Sender and Receiver). On dispatch, the internal support ticket will be updated by the Sender to the Recipient specifying the courier details, including the tracking reference.

### 1.6 Incident management procedures 

The package should arrive within the transfer service level stated. If the package is lost or becomes damaged in any way, the Recipient must inform the Sender as soon as this becomes clear. The circumstances of the loss or damage should be recorded, and the information security manager informed. Appropriate action will then be taken to address the situation. This may include: A. Informing senior management B. Informing regulatory authorities C. Beginning a forensic investigation Full cooperation will be required from all parties to the physical media transfer. 

### 1.7 Access control 

On arrival at the Receiver, access to the package must be strictly controlled. Only employees with sufficient clearance should be allowed to handle it. The package should be received in an area that has been assessed and cleared for the purpose and ideally to which public access is not permitted. The package should be signed for by an authorized individual only. Once fully received the internal support ticket should be updated. 

### 1.8 Decryption and processing 

Once received, the file will be decrypted using the appropriate key and passed to the relevant department for processing.
