## When a package ticket becomes over 60 days old; 

 ∙ Assign the ticket to billing and let them know the ticket is over 60 days and needs to be billed monthly. ▪ Make sure the ticket has been set to “Open” and is assigned to a specific billing team member before moving to billing support. ▪ Note in your staff comment if the ticket includes more than one package. o Billing will create the monthly service for package storage. o Billing will update the tickets subject line with “[B]” at the beginning to signify that the customer is being billed monthly for something in the ticket. o Billing will return the ticket to the incoming shipment department. ∙ Return the ticket to the “On-Hold” status. 

## While the package is in GIP Storage; 

 ∙ Send monthly reminders That we are still holding onto a package for them. ▪ If we get a bounce back from a bad email address, begin sending reminders to the primary contact for the company. 

## Once the package(s) in question have been removed from GIP’s Storage; 

 ∙ Update the ticket to notify the customer that the package was removed. ∙ Assign the ticket to billing once more to remove the monthly service. o Billing will return the ticket to the incoming shipment department with the “[B]” removed from the subject. (Meaning the customer is no longer being billed monthly for this ticket) ∙ Close the ticket.
