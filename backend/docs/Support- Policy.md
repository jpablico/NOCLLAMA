## SUPPORT POLICY 

This Support Policy sets forth the support services that Global IP Networks, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Global IP Networks”), provides to its customers (each, a “Customer”). **Level-1 Support (Complimentary, except as expressly noted below):** 

1. Basic reboot; when all that Customer requires is for Global IP Networks to turn a device off/on by pressing its power button or unplug     and plug its power cable. Power button or cable must be easily accessible and simple to operate. 

2. Connecting a pre-configured KVM over IP to Customer’s device, placing a CD/DVD onto a drive tray or replacing a hot swappable module.     Interface must be easily accessible and simple to operate. 

3. Use of Global IP Networks’ crash cart while in the facility on a first-come, first-served basis. 

4. KVM over IP rental is available on a first-come, first-served basis and is free of charge for the first 2 hours. After 2 hours, the rental fee     will be $30.00 per hour billed in 15-minute increments. 

5. Rack and mount a new and preconfigured 5U worth of servers or devices (maximum 35 lbs per item) per day. Rails and factory-supplied     accessories are required and the space must be easily accessible. 

6. Inbound shipping. For a larger or heavier item that requires dock access, a lift gate may be required to unload the shipment to Global IP     Networks’ ground-level dock. Customer should check with its shipper. Once received, Global IP Networks will place Customer’s shipment     at Global IP Networks’ storage for up to 30 days at no cost. After 30 days, the weekly storage cost is $20.00 per item or $15.00 per cubic     foot for large items. **Level-2 Support ($80.00/hour, billed at 15-minute increments):** 

1. Advanced reboot where monitoring, trouble shooting, or verification is required. 

2. Hardware and software install, configuration, replacement, and troubleshooting such as custom PDU setup, CPU and RAM install, OS     install, firewall configuration and other support where process monitoring is required. Specific instruction maybe required from     Customer’s vendors. 

3. De-rack and un-mount a server or a device, space organization and custom cabling. 

4. Support request that is not covered by Level-1 support. For example, if a hot swappable device needs to be replaced but the module is     covered with cables and is not easily accessible, then all the work to secure the cables and to provide access to the module prior to the     swap will fall into Level-2 support category. 

5. Outbound shipping (please see Global IP Networks’ outbound shipping policy below). **Outbound Shipping Policy** Global IP Networks understands how important Customer’s equipment is to its business. As servers come in many shapes and forms, Global IP Networks may not always have the proper box and padding material to safely pack Customer’s equipment for shipping. If Global IP Networks does not have the proper box and padding material, Global IP Networks will defer this task to a logistic company of Customer’s choice to handle the packing and shipping. Please follow the proper guidelines for equipment removal as described in the Master Service Terms and Conditions (http://gipnetworks.com/MSTC.pdf). Customer agrees that in no event shall Global IP Networks be liable for any loss or damage on Customer’s equipment and/or data before, during and after shipping.
