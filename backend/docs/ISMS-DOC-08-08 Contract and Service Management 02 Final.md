### Introduction 

This policy sets guidelines on how Global IP Networks handles client and vendor account management. Account management is the process of creating, maintaining, and removing accounts and services. Proper account management efforts are necessary to ensure client/ vendor relations stay positive and revenue/ costs are properly maintained. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document: 

- ISMS-DOC-07-03c Service Cancellation 02 Final 

- ISMS-DOC-07-03d Procurement and Purchasing 01 Final 

- ISMS-DOC-07-03b Billable Category 02 Final 

- ISMS-DOC-07-03f Closing Tickets in Zendesk 01 Final 

- ISMS-DOC-07-03e Procurement and Purchasing 02 Final 

## 1 Client account creation 

Each active client will need an account to be created in the billing platform. This account will list all client information such as contacts, permissions, services, contracts, etc. Any requests to modify client accounts needs to be processed via support ticket and only initiated by client contacts that have the proper permissions. 

### 1.1 Client contacts 

 Client contacts and authorities should be defined on the client account. This will help indicate which contacts may perform restricted actions such as adding services, removing services, making account changes, submitting support requests, paying invoices, etc. 

### 1.2 Client contracts 

 Client services are to be initiated by a signed service contract. Client contracts are to list all service items that are to be fulfilled by Global IP Networks along with the most current MSTC (master services terms and conditions) and a reference to the live document at http://gipnetworks.com/legal. The signed contract must also be uploaded to the billing platform so it may be referenced. A ticket must also be created to track the client onboarding process and invoice start date(s). 


 ISMS-DOC-08-08 Contract and Service Management 01 Final 

### 1.3 Contract term exceptions 

 Contract terms are defined in the contract and the MSTC. However, certain services may be delivered through third parties which may have terms that are dependent on external factors such as vendor agreements. It is important that all services are reviewed for any terms that may need to be defined that supersede both our contract and the MSTC. Any terms that are an exception to the MSTC should be clearly notated under the service(s) in question. 

## 2 Service adjustments 

Some services may follow a consumption or variable model. It is important that these services are updated monthly to reflect the most current usage. Any permanent adjustments to services such as service rates or terms should be initiated only by authorized client contacts and reviewed by authorized Global IP Networks personnel before any changes are made. 

### 2.1 Service additions and modifications 

 Service additions and modifications require either a new contract or adjustment to the existing contract. Service additions or modifications may extend, adopt, or replace the existing contract terms depending on the service in question. Service additions and modifications are only to be initiated by authorized client contacts and reviewed by authorized Global IP Networks personnel. Once approved, a ticket is to be created to track the progress of the new service(s). A new or modified agreement must also be signed by an authorized client contact. Once completed, the billing department is to be informed to initiate or modify billing via the ticket.

### 2.3 Definition of roles 

 The following defines the roles as described in the workflow above: A. Support staff: Employees outside of management and billing B. Management: Department managers, program manager, and executive team C. Billing: Employees in the billing department 

### 2.4 Workflow breakdown 

 A. New/ modified service request received a. This is either the action of a client sending in a ticket, or Global IP Networks employees creating the request on behalf of the client. Support staff should make sure to review if the person making the request is authorized to do so before continuing. B. Gather details of request a. Support staff will gather as many details from the client as possible. This can include when the service(s) are desired to start, what services are needing to be added/ modified, etc. C. Review request a. Management will review the request and details to determine how to best proceed. This could result in a new agreement being drafted or modified, the client to be put into contact with a partner, etc. Service modifications that result in a loss of revenue should be reviewed carefully for any terms and conditions that may apply. D. Create/ modify agreement(s) a. Management will oversee the drafting of the new or modified agreement. The document will undergo a final review before being sent out to the client. E. Request client signature a. Management will send out the new or modified agreement to the client for signature. This should only be sent to an authorized client contact. F. Agreement accepted/ declined a. If the client accepts and signs the agreement, the next step will be to upload the agreement to the billing platform accordingly. If the client declines the agreement, the process circles back to the “create/ modify agreement” step. It is possible for this process to end here if no agreement can be reached on both sides. G. Upload signed agreement a. Once the agreement is signed and accepted, the agreement must be uploaded to the billing platform for future reference and processing. H. Configure service(s) a. Support staff will be notified to configure any service(s) agreed upon in the signed document. In some cases, no changes will need to be made. I. Final review a. Management will review the service configuration to ensure everything is ready for invoicing. J. Begin invoicing 


 ISMS-DOC-08-08 Contract and Service Management 01 Final a. Billing is to be contacted to begin invoicing. If any special conditions apply, billing must be notified accordingly. This may include conditions such as specific billing start date(s), pricing conditions, etc. 

## 3 Service cancellations 

A service cancellation request must be sent from a client contact that has the appropriate permission to do so. All service cancellation requests should have a corresponding ticket created to track the progress of the request. 

### 3.1 Cancellation workflow 

 Cancellation requests will follow the following workflow. Throughout the workflow each step is highlighted by the role that is responsible.

### 3.2 Definition of roles 

 The following defines the roles as described in the workflow above: A. Support staff: Employees outside of management and billing B. Management: Department managers, program manager, and executive team C. Billing: Employees in the billing department 

### 3.3 Workflow breakdown 

 A. Cancellation request received a. This is either the action of a client sending in a ticket, or Global IP Networks employees creating the request on behalf of the client. Support staff should make sure to review if the person making the request is authorized to do so before continuing. B. Gather details of request a. Support staff will gather as many details from the client as possible. This can include when the cancellation is desired, what services are included in the cancellation, etc. It is important to note that support staff do not have the authority to confirm the cancellation without management review. C. Review cancellation request a. Management will review the details of the request. This review will check for any contractual or other stipulations that may exist on the account. D. Contract terms or conditions discovered or not discovered a. This will be determined by management during the review process. E. Client notified a. Management should notify the client on the results of the review. The client should also be notified of the details of their final invoice. F. Backend services removed a. Once the review process is complete, support staff will be instructed on what services to remove on the backend and when. This will ensure that Global IP Networks does not incur any unnecessary cost after the service cancellation is complete. G. Final review a. Management will conduct a final review of the service cancellation. Management will ensure that all backend services were removed correctly and that the cancellation is ready to proceed to the final step. H. Final invoice a. Management will inform the billing department that the final invoice is ready to be sent. This invoice will include any additional charges that may have been deemed necessary during the review process. At this time the client should already be notified and prepared for the contents of the final invoice. i. Note: for partial service removals, the final invoice will only apply to the particular service in question and not for the account as a whole.

### 3.4 Review process 

 Department managers will assess the cancellation request using the following guidelines A. Contractual obligations between the client and Global IP Networks B. Contractual obligations between Global IP Networks and vendors C. Client’s payment status (checking for overdue balances) If for any reason the above information cannot be reviewed, department managers will reach out to the program manager. If any further escalation is needed, the executive team will need to be contacted. Management’s standard approach to reviews will be to adhere to any discovered contract terms and conditions unless an exception is made by the executive team. 

### 3.5 Disputes and exceptions 

 At the end of the review process the client is to be contacted of the results. If the client has a dispute with the decisions made during the review process, department managers may escalate to the program manager and eventually the executive team if needed. If any exceptions are to be made, the executive team must approve any and all exceptions before management updates the client. 

## 4 Vendor agreements 

 Agreements that exist between Global IP Networks and a vendor need to be uploaded to the billing platform under the Global IP Networks client. These are to be stored and managed in the same manner as client agreements. Any vendor agreements that are in relation to client services should be indicated as such in the billing platform. Important: All agreements need to provide at a minimum the same level of security and compliance that Global IP Networks provides to its clients. 

## 5 Hybrid agreements 

 Hybrid agreements may exist that include both client and vendor agreement parameters. In such cases the terms and conditions from vendor agreements may supersede Global IP Network’s terms and conditions. This needs to be disclosed and clarified in the proposal. 


 ISMS-DOC-08-08 Contract and Service Management 01 Final 

## 6 Agreement review process 

 All client and vendor agreements will be reviewed 60 days prior to agreement expiration. A reminder will be sent via support ticket that will reference the agreement in question. During the review process, the following are examples of what should be considered. A. Should the agreement be renewed? B. Does the agreement still maintain the same level of security and compliance required to meet Global IP Networks standards? C. Does the agreement reflect current pricing, compliance and service standards? D. Are there any adjustments that should be made to the agreement to reflect the current business environment? E. Are there any commitment levels that can be adjusted for better pricing? At the end of the review process, the agreement should be granted final approval by the executive team before being signed or sent off for signature. Once a new signed agreement is received, the current agreement should be replaced in the billing platform and the old agreement archived. A new agreement expiration reminder should also be created so the process can be followed again.
