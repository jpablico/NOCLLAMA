## ABOUT THIS HANDBOOK/DISCLAIMER 

We prepared this handbook to help employees find the answers to many questions that they may have 

regarding their employment with Global IP Networks, Inc. Please take the necessary time to read it. 

We do not expect this handbook to answer all questions. Supervisors and Human Resources also serve as a 

major source of information. 

Neither this handbook nor any other verbal or written communication by a management representative is, nor 

should it be considered to be, an agreement, contract of employment, express or implied, or a promise of 

treatment in any particular manner in any given situation, nor does it confer any contractual rights whatsoever. 

Global IP Networks, Inc. adheres to the policy of employment at will, which permits the Company or the 

employee to end the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause or notice. 

No Company representative other than the President and/or the Vice President may modify at-will status 

and/or provide any special arrangement concerning terms or conditions of employment in an individual case 

or generally and any such modification must be in a signed writing. 

Many matters covered by this handbook, such as benefit plan descriptions, are also described in separate 

Company documents. These Company documents are always controlling over any statement made in this 

handbook or by any member of management. 

This handbook states only general Company guidelines. The Company may, at any time, in its sole discretion, 

modify or vary from anything stated in this handbook, with or without notice, except for the rights of the

employee and the President and/or the Vice President. 

This handbook supersedes all prior handbooks.

 Section 2 Governing Principles of Employment 

 2-1. Equal Employment Opportunity 

Global IP Networks, Inc. is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not discriminate on the basis of actual or 

perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including 

pregnancy, childbirth and pregnancy-related conditions), gender identity or expression (including transgender 

status), sexual orientation, marital status, military service and veteran status, physical or mental disability, 

genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws and 

ordinances. Global IP Networks, Inc.'s management team is dedicated to this policy with respect to 

recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities, 

access to facilities and programs and general treatment during employment. 

The Company will endeavor to make a reasonable accommodation of an otherwise qualified applicant or 

employee related to an individual's: physical or mental disability; sincerely held religious beliefs and 

practices; and/or any other reason required by applicable law, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship 

upon the Company's business operations. 

Any applicant or employee who needs an accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of the job 

should contact Human Resources to request such an accommodation. The individual should specify what 

accommodation is needed to perform the job and submit supporting documentation explaining the basis for the 

requested accommodation, to the extent permitted and in accordance with applicable law. The Company then 

will review and analyze the request, including engaging in an interactive process with the employee or 

applicant, to identify if such an accommodation can be made. The Company will evaluate requested 

accommodations, and as appropriate, identify other possible accommodations, if any. The individual will be 

notified of The Company's decision regarding the request within a reasonable period. The Company treats all 

medical information submitted as part of the accommodation process in a confidential manner. 

Any employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities in the workplace are 

encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of Human Resources. The Company will not allow any form 

of retaliation against individuals who raise issues of equal employment opportunity. If employees feel they 

have been subjected to any such retaliation, they should contact Human Resources. To ensure our workplace is 

free of artificial barriers, violation of this policy including any improper retaliatory conduct will lead to 

discipline, up to and including discharge. All employees must cooperate with all investigations conducted 

pursuant to this policy. 

 2-2. Non-Harassment 

It is Global IP Networks, Inc.'s policy to prohibit intentional and unintentional harassment of or against job 

applicants, contractors, interns, volunteers or employees by another employee, supervisor, vendor, customer or 

any third party on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, 

citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth and pregnancy-related conditions), 

gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, military service 


and veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by 

applicable federal, state or local laws (referred to as "protected characteristics"). Such conduct will not be 

tolerated by Global IP Networks, Inc. 

The purpose of this policy is not to regulate our employees' personal morality, but to ensure that no one 

harasses another individual in the workplace, including while on Company premises, while on Company 

business (whether or not on Company premises) or while representing the Company. In addition to being a 

violation of this policy, harassment or retaliation based on any protected characteristic as defined by applicable 

federal, state, or local laws also is unlawful. For example, sexual harassment and retaliation against an 

individual because the individual filed a complaint of sexual harassment or because an individual aided, 

assisted or testified in an investigation or proceeding involving a complaint of sexual harassment as defined by 

applicable federal, state, or local laws are unlawful. 

**Harassment Defined** 

Harassment generally is defined in this policy as unwelcome verbal, visual or physical conduct that denigrates 

or shows hostility or aversion towards an individual because of any actual or perceived protected characteristic 

or has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an 

intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 

Harassment can be verbal (including slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures or teasing), visual (including 

offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, text messages, social media posts or e

mails) or physical conduct (including physically threatening another, blocking someone's way, etc.). Such 

conduct violates this policy, even if it does not rise to the level of a violation of applicable federal, state or 

local laws. Because it is difficult to define unlawful harassment, employees are expected to behave at all times 

in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of this policy. 

**Sexual Harassment Defined** 

Sexual harassment can include all of the above actions, as well as other unwelcome conduct, such as 

unwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities 

and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 

 submission to that conduct or those advances or requests is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or 

 condition of an individual's employment; or 

 submission to or rejection of the conduct or advances or requests by an individual is used as the basis 

 for employment decisions affecting the individual; or 

 the conduct or advances or requests have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an 

 individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 

Examples of conduct that violate this policy include: 

 unwelcome flirtations, leering, whistling, touching, pinching, assault, blocking normal movement; 1. 

 requests for sexual favors or demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment; 2. 

 obscene or vulgar gestures, posters or comments; 3. 

 sexual jokes or comments about a person's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; 4. 

 propositions or suggestive or insulting comments of a sexual nature; 5. 


 derogatory cartoons, posters and drawings; 6. 

 sexually-explicit e-mails, text messages or voicemails; 7. 

 uninvited touching of a sexual nature; 8. 

 unwelcome sexually-related comments; 9. 

 conversation about one's own or someone else's sex life; 10. 

11. conduct or comments consistently targeted at only one gender, even if the content is not sexual; and 

 teasing or other conduct directed toward a person because of the person's gender. 12. 

**Reporting Procedures** 

If the employee has been subjected to or witnessed conduct which violates this policy, the employee should 

immediately report the matter to any member of management. If the employee is unable for any reason to 

contact this person, or if the employee has not received an initial response within five (5) business days after 

reporting any incident of what the employee perceives to be harassment, the employee should contact Human 

Resources. If the person toward whom the complaint is directed is one of the individuals indicated above, the 

employee should contact any higher-level manager in the reporting hierarchy. 

**Investigation Procedures** 

Every report of perceived harassment will be fully investigated, and corrective action will be taken where 

appropriate. All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be 

guaranteed. All employees must cooperate with all investigations conducted pursuant to this policy. 

**Retaliation Prohibited** 

In addition, the Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report unwelcome 

conduct to management or who cooperate in the investigations of such reports in accordance with this policy. 

If the employee has been subjected to any such retaliation, the employee should report it in the same manner in 

which the employee would report a claim of perceived harassment under this policy. 

Violation of this policy including any improper retaliatory conduct will result in disciplinary action, up to and 

including termination. 

 2-3. Drug-Free and Alcohol-Free Workplace 

To help ensure a safe, healthy and productive work environment for our employees and others, to protect 

Company property, and to ensure efficient operations, Global IP Networks, Inc. has adopted a policy of 

maintaining a workplace free of drugs and alcohol. This policy applies to all employees and other individuals 

who perform work for the Company. 

The unlawful or unauthorized use, abuse, solicitation, theft, possession, transfer, purchase, sale or distribution 

of controlled substances (including medical marijuana), drug paraphernalia or alcohol by an individual 

anywhere on Company premises, while on Company business (whether or not on Company premises) or while 

representing the Company, is strictly prohibited. Employees and other individuals who work for the Company 

also are prohibited from reporting to work or working while they are using or under the influence of alcohol or 

any controlled substances, which may impact the employee's ability to perform their job or otherwise pose 


safety concerns, except when the use is pursuant to a licensed medical practitioner's instructions and the 

licensed medical practitioner authorized the employee or individual to report to work. However, this exception 

does not extend any right to report to work under the influence of medical marijuana or to use medical 

marijuana as a defense to a positive drug test, to the extent the employee is subject to any drug testing 

requirement, except as permitted by and in accordance with applicable law. This restriction does not apply to 

responsible drinking of alcohol at business meetings and related social outings. 

Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 

The Company maintains a policy of non-discrimination and will endeavor to make reasonable accommodations 

to assist individuals recovering from substance and alcohol dependencies, and those who have a medical 

history which reflects treatment for substance abuse conditions. However, employees may not request an 

accommodation to avoid discipline for a policy violation. We encourage employees to seek assistance before 

their substance abuse or alcohol misuse renders them unable to perform the essential functions of their jobs, or 

jeopardizes the health and safety of any Company employee, including themselves. 

 2-4. Workplace Violence 

Global IP Networks, Inc. is strongly committed to providing a safe workplace. The purpose of this policy is to 

minimize the risk of personal injury to employees and damage to Company and personal property. 

Global IP Networks, Inc. does not expect employees to become experts in psychology or to physically subdue 

a threatening or violent individual. Indeed, Global IP Networks, Inc. specifically discourages employees from 

engaging in any physical confrontation with a violent or potentially violent individual. However, Global IP 

Networks, Inc. does expect and encourage employees to exercise reasonable judgment in identifying 

potentially dangerous situations. 

Experts in the mental health profession state that prior to engaging in acts of violence, troubled individuals 

often exhibit one or more of the following behaviors or signs: over-resentment, anger and hostility; extreme 

agitation; making ominous threats such as bad things will happen to a particular person, or a catastrophic event 

will occur; sudden and significant decline in work performance; irresponsible, irrational, intimidating, 

aggressive or otherwise inappropriate behavior; reacting to questions with an antagonistic or overtly negative 

attitude; discussing weapons and their use, and/or brandishing weapons in the workplace; overreacting or 

reacting harshly to changes in Company policies and procedures; personality conflicts with co-workers; 

obsession or preoccupation with a co-worker or supervisor; attempts to sabotage the work or equipment of a 

co-worker; blaming others for mistakes and circumstances; or demonstrating a propensity to behave and react 

irrationally. 

**Prohibited Conduct** 

Threats, threatening language or any other acts of aggression or violence made toward or by any Company 

employee WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. For purposes of this policy, a threat includes any verbal or physical 

harassment or abuse, any attempt at intimidating or instilling fear in others, menacing gestures, flashing of 

weapons, stalking or any other hostile, aggressive, injurious or destructive action undertaken for the purpose of 

domination or intimidation. To the extent permitted by law, employees and visitors are prohibited from 

carrying weapons onto Company premises. 


**Procedures for Reporting a Threat** 

All potentially dangerous situations, including threats by co-workers, should be reported immediately to any 

member of management with whom the employee feels comfortable. Reports of threats may be maintained 

confidential to the extent maintaining confidentiality does not impede Global IP Networks, Inc.'s ability to 

investigate and respond to the complaints. All threats will be promptly investigated. All employees must 

cooperate with all investigations. No employee will be subjected to retaliation, intimidation or disciplinary 

action as a result of reporting a threat in good faith under this policy. 

If the Company determines, after an appropriate good faith investigation, that someone has violated this policy, 

the Company will take swift and appropriate corrective action. 

If the employee is the recipient of a threat made by an outside party, that employee should follow the steps 

detailed in this section. It is important for the Company to be aware of any potential danger in its offices. 

Indeed, the Company wants to take effective measures to protect everyone from the threat of a violent act by 

employees or by anyone else. 


 Section 3 Operational Policies 

 3-1. Open Door Policy 

The Company is committed to maintaining a good working relationship with its employees. However, in any 

work environment there will be occasions when problems and complaints arise. It is important that these 

problems and complaints be discussed so that a resolution can be reached. Most problems can be solved; but if 

they are not freely discussed, they can become more serious. Therefore, it is the responsibility of everyone to 

help maintain a good working atmosphere. 

We have adopted the following procedure for handling suggestions, problems and complaints: 

1. Any employee who has a suggestion, problem, or complaint should discuss the matter with their Manager. 

2. If the suggestion, problem, or complaint is not satisfactorily resolved by the immediate Manager, or the 

problem or concern involves your Manager, the employee may meet with the next line of management official 

over his/her area, who will listen to the suggestion, problem, or complaint and attempt to recommend a 

satisfactory solution. 

3. If the suggestion, problem, or complaint has not been resolved, or if the nature of the problem is such that 

the employee does not want to discuss it with a manager, he/she may discuss it with a member of Human 

Resources. 

Employees may bring issues to a Human Resources Representative at any time. 

When an employee uses this Open Door Policy, he/she will receive an answer promptly. While the Company 

may not be able to provide the solution that you desire, we will listen to your concerns and have a frank and 

open communication with you regarding any issue you feel needs to be brought to Management's attention. 

Employees are encouraged to use the above procedures. Every effort will be made to render a fair and just 

decision. Once the decision is made, an explanation will be given to the employee who brought the suggestion, 

problem, or complaint. 

 3-2. Employee Classifications 

For purposes of this handbook, all employees fall within one of the classifications below. 

**Full-Time Employees** Employees who regularly work at least 40 hours per week who were not hired on a 

short-term basis. 

**Part-Time Employees** Employees who regularly work fewer than 40 hours per week who were not hired on 

a short-term basis. 

**Short-Term Employees** Employees who were hired for a specific short-term project, or on a short-term 


freelance, per diem or temporary basis. Short-term employees generally are not eligible for company benefits, 

but are eligible to receive statutory benefits. 

Employees who regularly work at least 30 or more hours per week who were not hired on a short-term basis 

are eligible for health insurance benefits. 

In addition to the above classifications, employees are categorized as either " **exempt** " or " **non-exempt** " for 

purposes of federal and state wage and hour laws. Employees classified as exempt do not receive overtime pay; 

they generally receive the same weekly salary regardless of hours worked. Such salary may be paid less 

frequently than weekly. The employee will be informed of these classifications upon hire and informed of any 

subsequent changes to the classifications. 

 3-3. Your Employment Records 

In order to obtain their position, employees have provided personal information, such as address and telephone 

number. This information is contained in their personnel file. 

Employees should keep their personnel files up to date by informing Human Resources of any changes. 

Employees also should inform Human Resources of any specialized training or skills they acquire, as well as 

any changes to any required visas. Unreported changes of address, marital status, etc. can affect withholding 

tax and benefit coverage. Further, an "out of date" emergency contact or an inability to reach employees in a 

crisis could cause a severe health or safety risk or other significant problem. 

 3-4. Working Hours and Schedule 

Global IP Networks, Inc. is a 24-hour, 7 days a week facility. 

Employees will be assigned a work schedule and will be expected to begin and end work according to the 

schedule. To accommodate the needs of the business, at some point Global IP Networks, Inc. may need to 

change individual work schedules on either a short-term or long-term basis. 

Employees are allowed 30 minute breaks in between their shifts. 

 3-5. Remote Work/Telecommuting 

Global IP Networks, Inc. may allow employees to work remotely if their job duties and work performance are 

determined to be eligible for remote work. Eligibility will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Company. 

Employees also may be required to work remotely during periods of public health emergencies if government 

orders and mandates recommend such work. 

This policy provides general information regarding remote work/telecommuting. Employees who are approved 

to work remotely should consult their individual agreement for specific details of their remote 

work/telecommuting arrangement, such as expected work hours, equipment provided, and other important 


information. 

Any remote work/telecommuting arrangement may be discontinued by the Company at any time and at the 

discretion of the Company. Employees also may discontinue the arrangement but may not be guaranteed office 

space at the Company's location. 

**At-Will Employment** 

This policy and any individual agreement addressing this work arrangement do not create a contract of 

employment and are not intended to be considered or construed as a promise of continued employment. 

Employment is at will and may be discontinued at any time by the Company or employee without notice, 

cause, or liability. 

**Hours of Work** 

Employees will work full time from home. Scheduled hours of work will be set by the employees' manager or 

supervisor. Employees should maintain regular contact with their supervisors and managers. 

Nonexempt employees must accurately record all hours worked pursuant to the Company's timekeeping 

system and take rest and meal breaks as if in the Company's workplace and as required by law. Nonexempt 

employees may not work beyond scheduled working hours (including working more than 40 hours in a 

workweek) without prior, written authorization from their manager or supervisor. 

**Location** 

Employees will provide, at their expense, a secure, dedicated work area. Employees are responsible for 

maintaining the work area in a safe, secure, and nonhazardous condition at all times. Employees will maintain 

security devices and procedures necessary to prevent use by unauthorized persons, including by preventing the 

connection of any Company-furnished computer system, network, or database to any computer, network, or 

database other than a computer, network, or database to which connections are provided or authorized by the 

Company. 

**Duties** 

Employees are expected to follow all existing Company policies and procedures. The duties, obligations, 

responsibilities, and conditions of employment with the Company remain unchanged. Employees must stay 

engaged with work throughout the workday and be fully available during normal business hours. If employees 

do not successfully perform their job duties remotely, this arrangement will be revoked. Employees are 

expected to follow existing Company policies with respect to scheduled and unscheduled time off, including 

the obligation to speak with their manager or supervisor before the scheduled start time in the event of an 

unscheduled absence, tardy, or early departure. 

**Accidents and Injuries** 

Employees agree to maintain safe conditions in the remote work space and to practice the same safety habits 

and rules applied on Company premises. If employees incur an injury arising out of the course and scope of the 

assigned job duties while working in a remote work space, the workers' compensation provisions in place for 

the state in which the employees are working will apply. Employees must notify their supervisor or manager 

immediately and complete all necessary and/or requested documents regarding the reported injury. The 

Company assumes no responsibility for injuries occurring in the remote work space outside normal working 


hours or for injuries that occur as a result of a reasonably recognizable unsafe remote work space. 

**Equipment** 

Employees agree to use electronic equipment that has been encrypted and meets all of the Company's security 

requirements. If the Company provides equipment for home use, employees agree to provide a secure location 

for Company-owned equipment and will not use, or allow others to use, such equipment for purposes other 

than Company business. Employees have no expectation of ownership in such equipment, linkages, property, 

or other items installed or provided by the Company. The Company will bear the expense of removal of any 

such equipment, linkages, and installations provided by the Company upon the termination of the remote 

work/telecommuting arrangement but not modification of or repairs to the work location. Employees hereby 

release the Company from any damage or liability incurred in the installing or removal of the equipment 

provided by the Company. 

**Return of Company Property** 

All equipment, records, and materials provided by the Company will remain Company property. Employees 

agree to return Company equipment, records, and materials upon request. All Company equipment will be 

returned by employees for inspection, repair, or replacement as needed or requested or immediately upon 

termination of the remote work/telecommuting arrangement. All equipment must be returned within five (5) 

business days of written notice to the employees. 

**Expenses** 

Upon presentment of receipts and in accordance with the Business Expense Reimbursement policy, the 

Company 

will reimburse employees for certain preapproved expenses. 

Regular household utility charges, such as electricity, water, phone, Internet service, auto, homeowners' 

insurance, etc., are not reimbursable unless state law requires reimbursement. 

**Confidentiality** 

Employees agree that they are subject to the Company's policies prohibiting the nonbusiness use or 

dissemination of the Company's confidential business information. Employees will take all appropriate steps to 

safeguard the Company's confidential business information, including segregating it from personal papers and 

documents, not allowing nonemployees to access such information, and keeping such information in locked 

drawers or file cabinets when not in use. Employees will maintain confidential information, including, but not 

limited to, information regarding the Company's products or services, processing, marketing and sales, client 

lists, client e-mail addresses and mailing addresses, client data, orders, memoranda, notes, records, technical 

data, sketches, designs, plans, drawings, trade secrets, research and development data, experimental work,

If employees have any questions concerning this policy or would like to apply to work remotely, they should 

contact Human Resources. 


 3-6. Timekeeping Procedures 

Employees must record their actual time worked for payroll and benefit purposes. Non-exempt employees 

must record the time work begins and ends, as well as the beginning and ending time of any departure from 

work for any non-work-related reason, on forms as prescribed by management. 

Altering, falsifying or tampering with time records is prohibited and subjects the employee to discipline, up to 

and including discharge. 

Exempt employees are required to record their daily work attendance and report full days of absence from 

work for reasons such as leaves of absence, sick leave or personal business. 

Non-exempt employees should report to work no more than 5 minutes prior to their scheduled starting time nor 

stay more than 5 minutes after their scheduled stop time without expressing prior authorization from their 

supervisor. 

It is the employee's responsibility to sign time records to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. Any errors 

in the time record should be reported immediately to a supervisor, who will attempt to correct legitimate errors. 

 3-7. Overtime 

Like most successful companies, Global IP Networks, Inc. experiences periods of extremely high activity. 

During these busy periods, additional work is required from all of us. Supervisors are responsible for 

monitoring business activity and requesting overtime work if it is necessary. Efforts will be made to provide 

employees with adequate advance notice in such situations. 

Any non-exempt employee who works overtime will be compensated at the rate of one and one-half times 

(1.5) their normal hourly wage for all time worked in excess of 40 hours each week, unless otherwise required 

by law. 

Employees may work overtime only with prior management authorization. 

For purposes of calculating overtime for non-exempt employees, the workweek begins at 12 a.m. on Sunday 

and ends 168 hours later at 12 a.m. on the following Sunday. 

 3-8. Safe Harbor Policy for Exempt Employees 

It is Global IP Networks, Inc.'s policy and practice to accurately compensate employees and to do so in 

compliance with all applicable state and federal laws. To ensure proper payment and that no improper 

deductions are made, employees must review pay stubs promptly to identify and report all errors. 

Those classified as exempt salaried employees will receive a salary which is intended to compensate them for 

all hours they may work for Global IP Networks, Inc. This salary will be established at the time of hire or 

classification as an exempt employee. While it may be subject to review and modification from time to time, 


such as during salary review times, the salary will be a predetermined amount that will not be subject to 

deductions for variations in the quantity or quality of the work performed. 

Under federal and state law, salary is subject to certain deductions. For example, unless state law requires 

otherwise, salary can be reduced for the following reasons: 

 full-day absences for personal reasons; 

 full-day absences for sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, 

 policy or practice of providing wage replacement benefits for such absences (deductions also may be 

 made for the exempt employee's full-day absences due to sickness or disability before the employee has 

 qualified for the plan, policy or practice or after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance under 

 the plan); 

 full-day disciplinary suspensions for infractions of our written policies and procedures; 

 Family and Medical Leave Act absences (either fullor partial-day absences); 

 to offset amounts received as payment from the court for jury and witness fees or from the military as 

 military pay; 

 the first or last week of employment in the event the employee works less than a full week; and 

 any full work week in which the employee does not perform any work. 

Salary may also be reduced for certain types of deductions such as a portion of health, dental or life insurance 

premiums; state, federal or local taxes; social security; or voluntary contributions to a 401(k) or pension plan. 

In any work week in which the employee performed any work, salary will not be reduced for any of the following 

reasons: 

 partial day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability; 

 an absence because the Company has decided to close a facility on a scheduled work day; 

 absences for jury duty, attendance as a witness, or military leave in any week in which the employee 

 performed any work (subject to any offsets as set forth above); and 

 any other deductions prohibited by state or federal law. 

However, unless state law provides otherwise, deductions may be made to accrued leave for fullor partial-day 

absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability. 

If employees believe they have been subject to any improper deductions, they should immediately report the 

matter to a supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or if the employee believes it would be inappropriate to 

contact that person (or if the employee has not received a prompt and fully acceptable reply), they should 

immediately contact Human Resources or any other supervisor in Global IP Networks, Inc. with whom the 

employee feels comfortable. 


 3-9. Your Paycheck 

Employees will be paid bi-weekly for all the time worked during the past pay period. 

Payroll stubs itemize deductions made from gross earnings. By law, Global IP Networks, Inc. is required to 

make deductions for Social Security, federal income tax and any other appropriate taxes. These required 

deductions also may include any court-ordered garnishments. Payroll stubs also will differentiate between 

regular pay received and overtime pay received. 

If there is an error in any employee's pay, the employee should bring the matter to the attention of Human 

Resources immediately so the Company can resolve the matter quickly and amicably. 

Paychecks will be given only to the employee, unless the employee requests that they be mailed or authorizes 

in writing that another person may accept the check. 

 3-10. Direct Deposit 

Global IP Networks, Inc. strongly encourages employees to use direct deposit. Authorization forms are 

available from Human Resources. 

 3-11. Salary Advances 

Global IP Networks, Inc. does not permit advances on paychecks or against accrued paid time off. Advance 

pay for vacation must be requested in writing at least two weeks prior to the vacation period. 

 3-12. Performance Review 

Depending on the employee's position and classification, Global IP Networks, Inc. endeavors to review 

performance annually. However, a positive performance evaluation does not guarantee an increase in salary, a 

promotion or continued employment. Compensation increases and the terms and conditions of employment, 

including job assignments, transfers, promotions, and demotions, are determined by and at the discretion of 

management. 

In addition to these formal performance evaluations, the Company encourages employees and supervisors to 

discuss job performance on a frequent and ongoing basis. 

 3-13. Record Retention 

Global IP Networks, Inc. acknowledges its responsibility to preserve information relating to litigation, audits 

and investigations. Failure on the part of employees to follow this policy can result in possible civil and 

criminal sanctions against the Company and its employees and possible disciplinary action against responsible 

individuals (up to and including discharge of the employee). Each employee has an obligation to contact the 


Human Resources to inform them of potential or actual litigation, external audit, investigation or similar 

proceeding involving the Company that may have an impact on record retention protocols. 

 3-14. Job Postings 

Global IP Networks, Inc. is dedicated to assisting employees in managing their careers and reaching their 

professional goals through promotion and transfer opportunities. This policy outlines the on-line job posting 

program which is in place for all employees. To be eligible to apply for an open position, employees must meet 

the following requirements 

 be a current, regular, full-time or part-time employee; 

 have been in current position for at least six (6) months; 

 maintain a performance rating of satisfactory or above; 

 not be on conduct/performance-related probation or warning; 

 meet the job qualifications listed on the job posting; and 

 provide their current manager with notice prior to applying for the position. 

If employees find a position of interest on the job posting website and they meet the eligibility requirements, an 

on-line job posting application must be completed in order to be considered for the position. Not all positions 

are guaranteed to be posted. The Company reserves the right to seek applicants solely from outside sources or 

to post positions internally and externally simultaneously. 

For more specific information about the program, please contact the Human Resources Department. 


 Section 4 Benefits 

 4-1. Benefits Overview 

In addition to good working conditions and competitive pay, it is Global IP Networks, Inc.'s policy to provide a 

combination of supplemental benefits to all eligible employees. In keeping with this goal, each benefit program 

has been carefully devised. These benefits include time-off benefits, such as vacations and holidays, and 

insurance and other plan benefits. We are constantly studying and evaluating our benefits programs and 

policies to better meet present and future requirements. These policies have been developed over the years and 

continue to be refined to keep up with changing times and needs. 

The next few pages contain a brief outline of the benefits programs Global IP Networks, Inc. provides 

employees and their families. Of course, the information presented here is intended to serve only as guidelines. 

The descriptions of the insurance and other plan benefits merely highlight certain aspects of the applicable 

plans for general information only. The details of those plans are spelled out in the official plan documents, 

which are available for review upon request from Human Resources. Additionally, the provisions of the plans, 

including eligibility and benefits provisions, are summarized in the summary plan descriptions ("SPDs") for 

the plans (which may be revised from time to time). In the determination of benefits and all other matters under 

each plan, the terms of the official plan documents shall govern over the language of any descriptions of the 

plans, including the SPDs and this handbook. 

Further, Global IP Networks, Inc. (including the officers and administrators who are responsible for 

administering the plans) retains full discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plans, as well as full 

discretionary authority with regard to administrative matters arising in connection with the plans and all issues 

concerning benefit terms, eligibility and entitlement. 

While the Company intends to maintain these employee benefits, it reserves the absolute right to modify, 

amend or terminate these benefits at any time and for any reason. 

If employees have any questions regarding benefits, they should contact Human Resources. 

 4-2. Paid and Observed Holidays 

All employees will be paid for the following holidays: 

 New Year's Day 

 Easter Sunday 

 Memorial Day 

 Independence Day 

 Labor Day 


 Thanksgiving Day 

 Christmas Day 

Salary employees observe the following holidays: 

 New Year's Day 

 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day 

 President's Day 

 Good Friday 

 Memorial Day 

 Independence Day 

 Larbor Day 

 Thanksgiving Day 

 Day after Thanksgiving 

 Christmas Day 

When holidays fall or are celebrated on a regular work day, eligible employees will receive one (1) day's pay at 

their regular straight-time rate. Eligible employees who are called in to work on a holiday will receive one (1) 

day's pay at their regular straight-time rate, and an additional payment of one and one-half times (1.5) their 

normal hourly wage for all time worked. 

If a holiday falls within an eligible employee's approved vacation period, the eligible employee will be paid for 

the holiday (at the regular straight-time rate) in addition to the vacation day, or the eligible employee will 

receive an additional vacation day at the option of the Company. 

If a holiday falls within a jury duty or bereavement leave, the eligible employee will be paid for the holiday (at 

the regular straight-time rate) in addition to the leave day, or the eligible employee will receive an additional 

day off at the option of the Company. 

 4-3. Paid Time Off (PTO) 

PTO is an inclusive paid time program for eligible employees which encompasses paid time off for illness, 

vacation or other personal pursuits in a flexible plan. Eligible employees are full-time employees who have 

completed the 90 days continuous working calendar period. Temporary, part-time and introductory employees 

are not eligible for PTO. The amount of employee's PTO accrued each year on the employee's anniversary 

year and is shown in the following schedule: 


 Years of Service PTO Hours 

 < 1 year 40 hours 

 1 to 2 years 80 hours 

 3 years 120 hours 

 4 years 160 hours 

 5 years+ 200 hours 

Other than sickness or emergency, eligible employees must request PTO in writing from their manager at least 

2 weeks in advance. Requests for PTO must be approved by the employee's manager. Your manager will 

determine the amount of leave available to the employee and approve or disapprove (all or part in hourly 

increments) requested. PTO requests will be reviewed based on a number of factors, including business needs 

and staffing requirements. Except for PTO taken for sick time or emergencies: 

1. PTO can only be used when your absence does not impose any undue hardship on your department or the 

Company's operations. 

2. The Company may require you to reschedule a previously approved PTO if its business needs make that 

necessary. 

3. The Company may require you to arrange for another person to handle your responsibilities while you are 

absent. 

Only under special circumstances will the employee be allowed to complete the written request after taking the 

PTO. This is strictly up to the employee's manager. 

Employees are responsible for accurately recording all PTO. When a full-time employee scheduled to work 40 

hours per week takes an entire day off as PTO, 8 hours of PTO must be recorded. PTO time taken during a 

given work week will not be included as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime. 

PTO must be taken or otherwise lost if unused. Any accrued but unused PTO cannot be cashed out and will be 

forfeited at the end of the year. However, at most forty (40) hours of unused PTO can carry over to the next 

anniversary year. The company may require employees to use any unpaid PTO during disability or family 

medical leave, or any other leave of absence. 

If an employee has unused PTO, he or she may not take unpaid time off and bank their PTO. Time off other 

than for the Company holidays will generally be charged against PTO accruals. PTO is intended for personal 

time off and is not intended to be used to make up for hours not worked in a given week in order to bring time 

up to weekly standard hours. The Company will pay for actual time (hours) worked and PTO is available for 

personal time away from work with supervisory approval. 

The Company will not pay for accrued but unused PTO upon separation. 


 4-4. Paid Pregnancy Disability Benefits 

Paid Pregnancy Disability Benefits may be available to full-time employees who have worked at Global IP 

Networks, Inc. for at least 12 consecutive months. Generally, eight (8) consecutive weeks of paid Pregnancy 

Disability Benefits will be granted to eligible employees who are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related 

medical conditions prior to and/or following the birth of a child. 

This benefit is calculated (based on the following chart) including any short-term disability benefits. 

Pregnancy Disability Benefits are solely a monetary benefit and not a leave of absence. Employees who will be 

out of work must also request a formal leave of absence. See the "Leaves of Absence" section of this handbook 

for more information. In addition, this Pregnancy Disability Benefit will be integrated with any applicable 

disability benefit offered by the Company or required by law, and employees must apply for such benefit as a 

condition of receipt of any Pregnancy Disability Benefit under this policy. 

 4-5. Lactation Breaks 

Global IP Networks, Inc. will provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate employees desiring 

to express breast milk for their infant child, in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable law. 

The break time, if possible, must run concurrently with rest and meal periods already provided. If the break 

time cannot run concurrently with rest and meal periods already provided, the break time will be unpaid, 

subject to applicable law. 

The Company will make reasonable efforts to provide employees with the use of a room or location other than 

a toilet stall to express milk in private. This location may be the employee's private office, if applicable. The 

Company may not be able to provide additional break time if doing so would seriously disrupt the Company's 

operations, subject to applicable law. Please consult Human Resources with questions regarding this policy. 

Employees should advise management if they need break time and an area for this purpose. Employees will not 

be discriminated against or retaliated against for exercising their rights under this policy. 

 4-6. Workers' Compensation 

On-the-job injuries are covered by Global IP Networks, Inc.'s Workers' Compensation Insurance Policy, which 

is provided at no cost. If employees are injured on the job, no matter how slightly, they should report the 

incident immediately to their supervisor. Failure to follow Company procedures may affect the ability of 

employees to receive Workers Compensation benefits. 

This is solely a monetary benefit and not a leave of absence entitlement. Employees who need to miss work 

due to a workplace injury must also request a formal leave of absence. See the Leave of Absence sections of 

this handbook for more information. 


 4-7. Jury Duty 

Global IP Networks, Inc. realizes that it is the obligation of all U.S. citizens to serve on a jury when summoned 

to do so. All employees will be allowed time off to perform such civic service as required by law. Employees 

are expected, however, to provide proper notice of a request to perform jury duty and verification of their 

service. 

Employees also are expected to keep management informed of the expected length of jury duty service and to 

report to work for the major portion of the day if excused by the court. If the required absence presents a 

serious conflict for management, employees may be asked to try to postpone jury duty. 

Employees on jury duty leave will be paid for their jury duty service in accordance with state law; however, 

exempt employees will be paid their full salary for any week in which time is missed due to jury duty if work 

is performed for the Company during such week. 

Please provide the necessary documentation to Human Resources. 

 4-8. Bereavement Leave 

The death of a family member is a time when employees wish to be with their families. If the employee is full

time and loses a close relative, the employee will be allowed paid time off of up to three (3) days to assist in 

attending to obligations and commitments. For the purposes of this policy, a close relative includes a spouse, 

child, parent, sibling, grandparents, or any other relation required by applicable law. Paid leave days only may 

be taken on regularly scheduled, consecutive workdays following the day of death. Employees must inform 

their supervisor prior to commencing bereavement leave. In administering this policy, Global IP Networks, 

Inc. require verification of death. 

 4-9. Voting Leave 

In the event employees do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote in a statewide election the 

employee may take off up to four (4) hours of their shift to vote. Such time will be paid if required by state 

law. This time should be taken at the beginning or end of the regular work schedule. Where possible, 

supervisors should be notified at least five (5) days prior to the voting day. 

 4-10. Long-Term Disability Benefits 

Full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Long-Term Disability plan, subject to all terms and 

conditions of the agreement between Global IP Networks, Inc. and the insurance carrier. 

This is solely a monetary benefit and not a leave of absence. Employees who will be out of work must also 

request a formal leave of absence. See the Leave of Absence sections of this handbook for more information. 


 4-11. Short-Term Disability Benefits 

Global IP Networks, Inc. provides enhanced monetary short-term disability benefits to full-time employees. 

These enhanced monetary benefits are inclusive of any monetary workers' compensation or statutory short

term disability benefits. 

This is not a leave of absence provision. Employees who will be out of work must request a leave of absence. 

See the Leave of Absence sections of this handbook for more information. Employees will be required to 

submit medical certification as requested by Global IP Networks, Inc. Required medical certification under 

this policy may differ from the medical certification required for any leave of absence requested. 

 4-12. Employee Assistance Program 

The Company recognizes that a wide range of problems such as marital or family distress, alcoholism, and 

drug abuse not directly associated with an individual's job function can nonetheless be detrimental to an 

employee's performance on the job. Consequently, we believe it is in the interest of employees and the 

Company to provide an effective program to assist employees and their families in resolving problems such as 

these as the need arises. To this end, the Company provides an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for 

employees and their eligible family members. The EAP is designed to provide voluntary, private, confidential, 

and professional counseling outside the workplace for any type of personal problem. The EAP provides 

consultation services for referrals to local community treatment sources. All employees are eligible to use this 

program and are encouraged to do so. Employee visits to the EAP are held in confidence to the maximum 

possible extent. 

Participation in the EAP does not excuse employees from otherwise complying with Company policies or from 

meeting normal job requirements during or after receiving assistance. Nor will participation in our employee 

assistance program prevent the Company from taking disciplinary action against any employee for 

performance problems that occur before, during, or after the employee seeks assistance through the program. 

 4-13. Employee Referral Awards 

Global IP Networks, Inc. encourages all employees to refer qualified job applicants for available job openings. 

Other than managers in the line of authority and all Human Resources personnel, all employees are eligible to 

receive employee referral awards. When making referrals, instruct the applicant to list the employee's name on 

their employment application as the referral source. If the referral is hired and completes 6 months of service 

and the employee is still the employee of the Company, the employee is eligible to receive a monetary award. 

The reward is currently a gross amount of $500. 


 4-14. Retirement Plan 

The Company has established a retirement savings plan to provide employees the potential for future financial 

security for retirement. If you have questions regarding the retirement savings benefit, please contact the CFO. 

 4-15. Health Insurance 

The Company provides full-time employees and their eligible dependents access to health insurance benefits. 

Eligible employees may participate in the health insurance plan and are subject to all terms and conditions of 

the agreement between the Company and the insurance carrier. Details of the health insurance plan are 

described in the Health Plan Options Booklet. The Health Plan Options Booklet and information on the cost of 

coverage will be provided in advance of the health insurance enrollment. Contact Human Resources for more 

information about health insurance benefits. 

 4-16. Dental Insurance 

The Company provides full-time employees and their eligible dependents access to dental insurance benefits. 

Eligible employees may participate in the dental insurance plan and are subject to all terms and conditions of 

the agreement between the Company and the insurance carrier. Details of the dental insurance plan are 

described in the Health Plan Options Booklet. The Health Plan Options Booklet and information on the cost of 

coverage will be provided in advance of the dental insurance enrollment. Contact Human Resources for more 

information about dental insurance benefits. 

 4-17. Vision Insurance 

The Company provides full-time employees and their eligible dependents access to vision insurance benefits.

the agreement between the Company and the insurance carrier. Details of the vision insurance plan are 

described in the Health Plan Options Booklet. The Health Plan Options Booklet and information on the cost of 

coverage will be provided in advance of the vision insurance enrollment. Contact Human Resources for more 

information about vision insurance benefits. Life Insurance The Company offers full-time employees access to 

life insurance. Eligible employees may participate in the life insurance plan and are subject to all terms and 

conditions of the agreement between the Company and the insurance carrier. Contact Human Resources for 

more information about life insurance. 


 Section 5 Leaves of Absence 

 5-1. Personal Leave 

If employees are ineligible for any other Company leave of absence, Global IP Networks, Inc., under certain 

circumstances, may grant a personal leave of absence without pay. A written request for personal leave should 

be presented to management at least two (2) weeks before the anticipated start of the leave. If the leave is 

requested for medical reasons and employees are not eligible for leave under the federal Family and Medical 

Leave Act (FMLA) or any state leave law, medical certification also must be submitted. The request will be 

considered on the basis of staffing requirements and the reasons for the requested leave, as well as performance 

and attendance records. Normally, a leave of absence will be granted for a period of up to eight (8) weeks. 

However, a personal leave may be extended if, prior to the end of leave, employees submit a written request 

for an extension to management and the request is granted. During the leave, employees will not earn vacation, 

personal days or sick days. We will continue health insurance coverage during the leave if employees submit 

their share of the monthly premium payments to the Company in a timely manner, subject to the terms of the 

plan documents. 

When the employee anticipates returning to work, he or she should notify management of the expected return 

date. This notification should be made at least one week before the end of the leave. 

Upon completion of the personal leave of absence, the Company will attempt to return employees to their 

original job or a similar position, subject to prevailing business considerations. Reinstatement, however, is not 

guaranteed. 

Failure to advise management of availability to return to work, failure to return to work when notified or a 

continued absence from work beyond the time approved by the Company will be considered a voluntary 

resignation of employment. 

Personal leave runs concurrently with any Company-provided Short-Term Disability Leave of Absence. 

 5-2. Military Leave 

If employees are called into active military service or enlist in uniformed service, they will be eligible to 

receive an unpaid military leave of absence. To be eligible for military leave, employees must provide 

management with advance notice of service obligations unless they are prevented from providing such notice 

by military necessity or it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable to provide such notice. Provided the absence 

does not exceed applicable statutory limitations, employees will retain reemployment rights and accrue 

seniority and benefits in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. Employees should ask management 

for further information about eligibility for Military Leave. 

If employees are required to attend yearly Reserves or National Guard duty, they can apply for an unpaid 

temporary military leave of absence not to exceed the number of days allowed by law (including travel). They 


should give management as much advance notice of their need for military leave as possible so that Global IP 

Networks, Inc. can maintain proper coverage while employees are away. 


 Section 6 General Standards of Conduct 

 6-1. Workplace Conduct 

Global IP Networks, Inc. endeavors to maintain a positive work environment. Each employee plays a role in 

fostering this environment. Accordingly, we all must abide by certain rules of conduct, based on honesty, 

common sense and fair play. 

Because everyone may not have the same idea about proper workplace conduct, it is helpful to adopt and 

enforce rules all can follow. Unacceptable conduct may subject the offender to disciplinary action, up to and 

including discharge, at the Company's sole discretion. The following are examples of some, but not all, 

conduct which can be considered unacceptable: 

? Obtaining employment on the basis of false or misleading information. 

? Stealing, removing or defacing Global IP Networks, Inc. property or a co-worker's property, and/or disclosure 

of confidential information. 

? Completing another employee's time records. 

? Violation of safety rules and policies. 

? Violation of Global IP Networks, Inc.'s Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace Policy. 

? Fighting, threatening or disrupting the work of others or other violations of Global IP Networks, Inc.'s W 

orkplace Violence Policy. 

? Failure to follow lawful instructions of a supervisor. 

? Failure to perform assigned job duties. 

? Violation of the Punctuality and Attendance Policy, including but not limited to irregular attendance, habitual 

lateness or unexcused absences. 

? Gambling on Company property. 

? Willful or careless destruction or damage to a company's assets or to the equipment or possessions of another 

employee. 

? Wasting work materials. 

? Performing work of a personal nature during work time. 

? Violation of the Solicitation and Distribution Policy. 

? Violation of Global IP Networks, Inc.'s Harassment or Equal Employment Opportunity Policies. 

? Violation of the Communication and Computer Systems Policy. 

? Unsatisfactory job performance. 

? Any other violation of Global IP Networks, Inc. policy. 

Obviously, not every type of misconduct can be listed. Note that all employees are employed at-will, and 

Global IP Networks, Inc. reserves the right to impose whatever discipline it chooses, or none at all, in a 

particular instance. The Company will deal with each situation individually and nothing in this handbook 

should be construed as a promise of specific treatment in a given situation. However, Global IP Networks, Inc. 

will endeavor to utilize progressive discipline but reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate the 

employee at any time for any reason. 

The observance of these rules will help to ensure that our workplace remains a safe and desirable place to 


work. 

 6-2. Punctuality and Attendance 

Employees are hired to perform important functions at Global IP Networks, Inc. As with any group effort, 

operating effectively takes cooperation and commitment from everyone. Therefore, attendance and punctuality 

are very important. Unnecessary absences and lateness are expensive, disruptive and place an unfair burden on 

fellow employees and supervisors. We expect excellent attendance from all employees. Excessive absenteeism 

or tardiness will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 

We do recognize, however, there are times when absences and tardiness cannot be avoided. In such cases, 

employees are expected to notify Supervisors as early as possible, but no later than the start of the work day. 

Asking another employee, friend or relative to give this notice is improper and constitutes grounds for 

disciplinary action. Employees should call, stating the nature of the illness and its expected duration, for every 

day of absenteeism. 

Unreported absences of three (3) consecutive work days generally will be considered a voluntary resignation of 

employment with the Company. 

 6-3. Use of Communications and Computer Systems 

Global IP Networks, Inc.'s communication and computer systems are intended primarily for business purposes. 

However, limited personal usage is permitted if it does not hinder performance of job duties or violate any 

other Company policy. This includes voice mail, e-mail and Internet systems. Users have no legitimate 

expectation of privacy in regard to their use of the Global IP Networks, Inc. systems. 

Global IP Networks, Inc. may access the voice mail and e-mail systems and obtain communications within the 

systems, including past voice mail and e-mail messages, without notice to users of the system, in the ordinary 

course of business when the Company deems it appropriate to do so. The reasons for which the Company may 

obtain such access include, but are not limited to: maintaining the system; preventing or investigating 

allegations of system abuse or misuse; assuring compliance with software copyright laws; complying with 

legal and regulatory requests for information; and ensuring that the Company's operations continue 

appropriately during the employee's absence. 

Further, Global IP Networks, Inc. may review Internet usage to ensure that such use with Company property, 

or communications sent via the Internet with Company property, are appropriate. The reasons for which the 

Company may review employees' use of the Internet with Company property include, but are not limited to: 

maintaining the system; preventing or investigating allegations of system abuse or misuse; assuring compliance 

with software copyright laws; complying with legal and regulatory requests for information; and ensuring that 

Company operations continue appropriately during the employee's absence. 

The Company may store electronic communications for a period of time after the communication is created. 


From time to time, copies of communications may be deleted. 

The Company's policies prohibiting harassment, in their entirety, apply to the use of the Company's 

communication and computer systems. No one may use any communication or computer system in a manner 

that may be construed by others as harassing or offensive based on race, national origin, sex, sexual 

orientation, age, disability, religious beliefs or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law. 

Further, since the Company's communication and computer systems are intended for business use, all 

employees, upon request, must inform management of any private access codes or passwords. 

Unauthorized duplication of copyrighted computer software violates the law and is strictly prohibited. 

No employee may access, or attempt to obtain access to, another employee's computer systems without 

appropriate authorization. 

Violators of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. 

 6-4. Use of Social Media 

Global IP Networks, Inc. respects the right of any employee to maintain a blog or web page or to participate on 

a social networking site, Twitter or similar site, including but not limited to Facebook and LinkedIn. However, 

to protect Company interests and ensure employees focus on their job duties, employees must adhere to the 

following rules: 

Unless authorized by company executive leadership, employees may not post on a blog or web page or 

participate on a social networking platform, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or similar site, during work 

time (excluding break time) or at any time with Company equipment or property. 

All rules regarding confidential and proprietary business information apply in full to blogs, web pages and 

social networking platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or similar sites. Any information that cannot 

be disclosed through a conversation, a note or an e-mail also cannot be disclosed on a blog, web page or social 

networking site. 

Whether the employees are posting something on their own blog, web page, social networking, Twitter or 

similar site or on someone else's, if the employee mentions the Company and also expresses either a political 

opinion or an opinion regarding the Company's actions that could pose an actual or potential conflict of interest 

with the Company, the poster must include a disclaimer. The poster should specifically state that the opinion 

expressed is a personal opinion and not the Company's position. This is necessary to preserve the Company's 

good will in the marketplace. 

Any conduct that is impermissible under the law if expressed in any other form or forum is impermissible if 

expressed through a blog, web page, social networking, Twitter or similar site. For example, posted material 

that is discriminatory, obscene, defamatory, libelous or violent is forbidden. Company policies apply equally to 


employee social media usage. 

Global IP Networks, Inc. encourages all employees to keep in mind the speed and manner in which 

information posted on a blog, web page, and/or social networking site is received and often misunderstood by 

readers. Employees must use their best judgment. Employees with any questions should review the guidelines 

above and/or consult with their manager. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in discipline, up to and 

including discharge. 

 6-5. Personal and Company-Provided Portable Communication Devices 

Global IP Networks, Inc.-provided portable communication devices (PCDs), including cell phones and 

personal digital assistants, should be used primarily for business purposes. Employees have no reasonable 

expectation of privacy in regard to the use of such devices, as it relates specifically to the Company, since all 

use of company-provided PCD is subject to monitoring for security purposes, to the maximum extent permitted 

by applicable law. 

Employees opting to use their own PCD for business purposes must request prior authorization. Once 

authorized, employees should work with the IT department to configure their PCD for business use. 

Communications related to the company, sent via a personal PCD, may be subject to monitoring if sent through 

the Company's networks. Upon request, PCD must be provided for inspection and review, under the 

supervision of the device's owner, as it relates specifically to any company matter or conversation sent from a 

personal PCD. 

All conversations, text messages and e-mails must be professional. When sending a text message or using a 

PCD for business purposes, whether it is a Company-provided or personal device, employees must comply 

with applicable Company guidelines, including policies on sexual harassment, discrimination, conduct, 

confidentiality, equipment use and operation of vehicles. 

If an employee who uses a personal PCD for business resigns or is discharged, the employee understands that 

all access to the company related data and applications will be removed. The removal of Company information 

is crucial to ensure compliance with the Company's confidential and proprietary information policies and 

objectives. 

Please note that whether employees use their personal PCD or a Company-issued device, the Company's 

electronic communications policies, including but not limited to, proper use of communications and computer 

systems, remain in effect. 

**Portable Communication Device Use While Driving** 

Employees who drive a Company vehicle must abide by all state or local laws prohibiting or limiting PCD 

(cell phone or personal digital assistant) use while driving. Further, even if usage is permitted, employees may 

choose to refrain from using any PCD while driving. "Use" includes, but is not limited to, talking or listening 

to another person or sending an electronic or text message via PCD. 


Regardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped traffic, if any use is permitted while driving, 

employees should proceed to a safe location off the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting 

a call. If acceptance of a call is absolutely necessary while driving, and permitted by law, employees must use 

a hands-free option and advise the caller that they are unable to speak at that time and will return the call 

shortly. 

Under no circumstances should employees feel that they need to place themselves at risk to fulfill business 

needs. 

Since this policy does not require any employee to use a cell phone while driving, employees who are charged 

with traffic violations resulting from the use of their PCDs while driving will be solely responsible for all 

liabilities that result from such actions. 

Texting and emailing while driving is prohibited under all circumstances. 

 6-6. Inspections 

In the unlikely event that requires inspections, the Company shall abide by all local laws and regulations and 

defer to the local authorities. 

 6-7. Smoking 

Smoking, including the use of e-cigarettes, should be in accordance with the city and local regulations and is 

prohibited in all Company premises and vehicles. 

 6-8. Personal Visits and Telephone Calls 

Disruptions during work time can lead to errors and delays. Therefore, personal telephone calls must be kept to 

a minimum, and only be made or received after working time, or during lunch or break time. 

For safety and security reasons, employees are prohibited from having personal guests visit or accompanying 

them anywhere in Global IP Networks, Inc. facilities other than the reception areas. 

 6-9. Solicitation and Distribution 

To avoid distractions, solicitation by the employee of another employee is prohibited while either employee is 

on work time. "Work time" is defined as the time the employee is engaged, or should be engaged, in 

performing their work tasks for Global IP Networks, Inc. Solicitation of any kind by non-employees on 

Company premises is prohibited at all times. 

Distribution of advertising material, handbills, printed or written literature of any kind in working areas of the 

Company is prohibited at all times. Distribution of literature by non-employees on Company premises is 


prohibited at all times. 

 6-10. Billboard Channel 

Important notices and items of general interest are continually posted on Global IP Networks, Inc. billboard 

channel in Slack. Employees should make it a practice to review bulletin boards frequently. This will assist 

employees in keeping up with what is current at Global IP Networks, Inc. To avoid confusion, employees 

should not post or remove any notices on the billboard channel. 

 6-11. Confidential Company Information 

During the course of work, employees may become aware of confidential information about Global IP 

Networks, Inc.'s business, including but not limited to information regarding Company finances, pricing, 

products and new product development, software and computer programs, marketing strategies, suppliers and 

customers and potential customers. Employees also may become aware of similar confidential information 

belonging to the Company's clients. It is extremely important that all such information remain confidential, and 

particularly not be disclosed to Global IP Networks, Inc.'s competitors. Any employee who improperly copies, 

removes (whether physically or electronically), uses or discloses confidential information to anyone outside of 

the Company may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Employees may be 

required to sign an agreement reiterating these obligations. 

 6-12. Conflict of Interest and Business Ethics 

It is Global IP Networks, Inc.'s policy that all employees avoid any conflict between their personal interests 

and those of the Company. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the Company's honesty and integrity, 

and therefore its reputation, are not compromised. The fundamental principle guiding this policy is that no 

employee should have, or appear to have, personal interests or relationships that actually or potentially conflict 

with the best interests of the Company. 

It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of situations that might involve violations of this policy. However, 

the situations that would constitute a conflict in most cases include but are not limited to: 

 holding an interest in or accepting free or discounted goods from any organization that does, or is 1. 

 seeking to do, business with the Company, by any employee who is in a position to directly or indirectly 

 influence either the Company's decision to do business, or the terms upon which business would be 

 done with such organization; 

 holding any interest in an organization that competes with the Company; 2. 

 being employed by (including as a consultant) or serving on the board of any organization which does, 3. 

 or is seeking to do, business with the Company or which competes with the Company; and/or 

 profiting personally, e.g., through commissions, loans, expense reimbursements or other payments, 4. 

 from any organization seeking to do business with the Company. 

A conflict of interest would also exist when a member of the employee's immediate family is involved in 


situations such as those above. 

This policy is not intended to prohibit the acceptance of modest courtesies, openly given and accepted as part 

of the usual business amenities, for example, occasional business-related meals or promotional items of 

nominal or minor value. 

It is the employee's responsibility to report any actual or potential conflict that may exist between the employee 

(and the employee's immediate family) and the Company. 

 6-13. Use of Facilities, Equipment and Property, Including Intellectual Property 

Equipment essential in accomplishing job duties is often expensive and may be difficult to replace. When using 

property, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating 

instructions, safety standards and guidelines. 

Employees should notify their supervisor if any equipment, machines, or tools appear to be damaged, defective 

or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of loss, damages, defects and the need for repairs could prevent 

deterioration of equipment and possible injury to employees or others. Supervisors can answer any questions 

about the employees' responsibility for maintenance and care of equipment used on the job. 

Employees also are prohibited from any unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property, such as audio 

and video tapes, print materials and software. 

Improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment can result in discipline, up 

to and including discharge. 

Further, the Company is not responsible for any damage to employees' personal belongings unless the 

employee's supervisor provided advance approval for the employee to bring the personal property to work. 

 6-14. Health and Safety 

The health and safety of employees and others on Company property are of critical concern to Global IP 

Networks, Inc. The Company intends to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business. To 

this end, we must rely upon employees to ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous 

conditions. Employees are required to be conscientious about workplace safety, including proper operating 

methods, and recognize dangerous conditions or hazards. Any unsafe conditions or potential hazards should be 

reported to management immediately, even if the problem appears to be corrected. Any suspicion of a 

concealed danger present on the Company's premises, or in a product, facility, piece of equipment, process or 

business practice for which the Company is responsible should be brought to the attention of management 

immediately. 

Periodically, the Company may issue rules and guidelines governing workplace safety and health. The 

Company may also issue rules and guidelines regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and 

waste. All employees should familiarize themselves with these rules and guidelines, as strict compliance will 

be expected. 

Any workplace injury, accident, or illness must be reported to the employee's supervisor as soon as possible, 


regardless of the severity of the injury or accident. 

 6-15. Hiring Relatives/Employee Relationships 

A familial relationship among employees can create an actual or at least a potential conflict of interest in the 

employment setting, especially where one relative supervises another relative. To avoid this problem, Global 

IP Networks, Inc. may refuse to hire or place a relative in a position where the potential for favoritism or 

conflict exists. 

In other cases, such as personal relationships where a conflict or the potential for conflict arises, even if there is 

no supervisory relationship involved, the parties may be separated by reassignment or discharged from 

employment, at the discretion of the Company. Accordingly, all parties to any type of intimate personal 

relationship must inform management. 

If two employees marry, become related, or enter into an intimate relationship, they may not remain in a 

reporting relationship or in positions where one individual may affect the compensation or other terms or 

conditions of employment of the other individual. The Company generally will attempt to identify other 

available positions, but if no alternate position is available, the Company retains the right to decide which 

employee will remain with the Company. 

For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage, or whose 

relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. 

 6-16. Employee Dress and Personal Appearance 

Employees are expected to report to work or attend video conference calls well groomed, clean, and dressed in 

business casual or professional attire which includes, but not limited to, slacks, dress jeans, dress, skirt, polo 

shirt, button down shirt, blouse and appropriate footwear for a business setting. Some prohibited clothing 

includes, but not limited to, workout attire, cut off shorts or jeans, jeans with holes, shorts, ball caps, flip-flops, 

hoodies or shoes without toe coverings, t-shirts and any attire which may be revealing or contains profanity or 

other inappropriate material visible. Some employees may be required to wear safety equipment/clothing. 

Employees should contact their supervisor for specific information regarding acceptable attire for their 

position. If employees report to work dressed or groomed inappropriately, they may be prevented from 

working until they return to work well groomed and wearing the proper attire. Continued violations may result 

in disciplinary action. 

 6-17. Housekeeping 

Neatness and good housekeeping are signs of organization and efficiency. Employees are expected to keep 

themselves and the work areas neat and orderly at all times, since this is required as a safety precaution that 

also creates a good impression for visitors and customers. 

Easily accessible trash bins and recycling containers (where applicable) are located throughout the company 

offices. Please put all litter and recyclable materials in the appropriate bin and containers. Always be aware of 


good health and safety standards, including fire and loss prevention. Employees should report anything that 

needs repairing or replacing to the supervisor immediately. 

 6-18. Publicity/Statements to the Media 

All media inquiries regarding the position of the Company as to any issues must be referred to the President. 

Only the President is authorized to make or approve public statements on behalf of the Company. No 

employees, unless specifically designated by the President, are authorized to make those statements on behalf 

of Company. Any employee wishing to write and/or publish an article, paper, or other publication on behalf of 

the Company must first obtain approval from the President. 

 6-19. Operation of Vehicles 

All employees authorized to drive Company-owned or leased vehicles or personal vehicles in conducting 

Company business must possess a current, valid driver's license and an acceptable driving record. Any change 

in license status or driving record must be reported to management immediately. 

Employees must have a valid driver's license in their possession while operating a vehicle off or on Company 

property. It is the responsibility of every employee to drive safely and obey all traffic, vehicle safety, and 

parking laws or regulations. Drivers must demonstrate safe driving habits at all times. 

Company-owned or leased vehicles may be used only as authorized by management. 

**Portable Communication Device Use While Driving** 

Employees who drive on Company business must abide by all state or local laws prohibiting or limiting 

portable communication device (PCD) use, including cell phones or personal digital assistants, while driving. 

Further, even if use is permitted, employees may choose to refrain from using any PCD while driving. "Use" 

includes, but is not limited to, talking or listening to another person or sending an electronic or text message 

via the PCD. 

Regardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped traffic, if any use is permitted while driving, 

employees should proceed to a safe location off the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting 

a call. If acceptance of a call is absolutely necessary while the employees are driving, and permitted by law, 

they must use a hands-free option and advise the caller that they are unable to speak at that time and will return 

the call shortly. 

Under no circumstances should employees feel that they need to place themselves at risk to fulfill business 

needs. 

Since this policy does not require any employee to use a PCD while driving, employees who are charged with 

traffic violations resulting from the use of their PCDs while driving will be solely responsible for all liabilities 

that result from such actions. 

Texting and e-mailing while driving is prohibited in all circumstances. 


 6-20. Gifts and Favors 

No employee shall solicit or accept for personal use, or for the use of others, a gift, favor or loan, gratuity, 

reward, promise of future employment, or any other thing of monetary value that might influence, or appear to 

influence, the judgment or conduct of the employee in the performance of their job. 

Employees are not to give, offer, or promise directly or indirectly anything of value to any representative of a 

customer, a potential customer, a vendor or potential vendor, financial institution or potential financial 

institution with whom the Company has or may have a business relationship. 

 6-21. Business Expense Reimbursement 

Employees will be reimbursed for reasonable approved expenses incurred in the course of business. These 

expenses must be approved by the employee's Supervisor, and may include air travel, hotels, motels, meals, 

cab fare, rental vehicles, or gas and car mileage for personal vehicles. All expenses incurred should be 

submitted to Human Resources along with the receipts in a timely manner. 

Employees are expected to exercise restraint and good judgment when incurring expenses. Employees should 

contact their Supervisor in advance if they have any questions about whether an expense will be reimbursed. 

 6-22. References 

Global IP Networks, Inc. will respond to reference requests through the Human Resources Department. The 

Company will provide general information concerning the employee such as date of hire, date of discharge, 

and positions held. Requests for reference information must be in writing, and responses will be in writing. 

Please refer all requests for references to the Human Resources Department. 

**Only the Human Resources Department may provide references.** 

 6-23. If You Must Leave Us 

Should the employee decide to leave the Company, we ask that they provide a Supervisor with at least two (2) 

weeks advance notice of departure. Thoughtfulness will be appreciated. All Company, property including, but 

not limited to, keys, security cards, parking passes, laptop computers, fax machines, uniforms, etc., must be 

returned at separation. Employees also must return all of the Company's Confidential Information upon 

separation. To the extent permitted by law, employees will be required to repay the Company (through payroll 

deduction, if lawful) for any lost or damaged Company property. As noted previously, all employees are 

employed at-will and nothing in this handbook changes that status. 


 6-24. Exit Interviews 

Employees who resign are requested to participate in an exit interview with Human Resources, if possible. 

 6-25. A Few Closing Words

Networks, Inc. The information in this handbook is general in nature and, should questions arise, any member 

of management should be consulted for complete details. While we intend to continue the policies, rules and

 Receipt of Non-Harassment Policy 

It is Global IP Networks, Inc.'s policy to prohibit intentional and unintentional harassment of or against job 

applicants, contractors, interns, volunteers or employees by another employee, supervisor, vendor, customer or 

any third party on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, 

citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth and pregnancy-related conditions), 

gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, military service 

and veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by 

applicable federal, state or local laws (referred to as "protected characteristics"). Such conduct will not be 

tolerated by Global IP Networks, Inc. 

The purpose of this policy is not to regulate our employees' personal morality, but to ensure that no one 

harasses another individual in the workplace, including while on Company premises, while on Company 

business (whether or not on Company premises) or while representing the Company. In addition to being a 

violation of this policy, harassment or retaliation based on any protected characteristic as defined by applicable 

federal, state, or local laws also is unlawful. For example, sexual harassment and retaliation against an 

individual because the individual filed a complaint of sexual harassment or because an individual aided, 

assisted or testified in an investigation or proceeding involving a complaint of sexual harassment as defined by 

applicable federal, state, or local laws are unlawful. 

**Harassment Defined** 

Harassment generally is defined in this policy as unwelcome verbal, visual or physical conduct that denigrates 

or shows hostility or aversion towards an individual because of any actual or perceived protected characteristic 

or has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an 

intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 

Harassment can be verbal (including slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures or teasing), visual (including 

offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, text messages, social media posts or e

mails) or physical conduct (including physically threatening another, blocking someone's way, etc.). Such 

conduct violates this policy, even if it does not rise to the level of a violation of applicable federal, state or 

local laws. Because it is difficult to define unlawful harassment, employees are expected to behave at all times 

in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of this policy. 

**Sexual Harassment Defined** 

Sexual harassment can include all of the above actions, as well as other unwelcome conduct, such as 

unwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities 

and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 

 submission to that conduct or those advances or requests is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or 

 condition of an individual's employment; or 

 submission to or rejection of the conduct or advances or requests by an individual is used as the basis 

 for employment decisions affecting the individual; or 

 the conduct or advances or requests have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an 


 individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 

Examples of conduct that violate this policy include: 

 unwelcome flirtations, leering, whistling, touching, pinching, assault, blocking normal movement; 1. 

 requests for sexual favors or demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment; 2. 

 obscene or vulgar gestures, posters or comments; 3. 

 sexual jokes or comments about a person's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; 4. 

 propositions or suggestive or insulting comments of a sexual nature; 5. 

 derogatory cartoons, posters and drawings; 6. 

 sexually-explicit e-mails, text messages or voicemails; 7. 

 uninvited touching of a sexual nature; 8. 

 unwelcome sexually-related comments; 9. 

 conversation about one's own or someone else's sex life; 10. 

11. conduct or comments consistently targeted at only one gender, even if the content is not sexual; and 

 teasing or other conduct directed toward a person because of the person's gender. 12. 

**Reporting Procedures** 

If the employee has been subjected to or witnessed conduct which violates this policy, the employee should 

immediately report the matter to any member of management. If the employee is unable for any reason to 

contact this person, or if the employee has not received an initial response within five (5) business days after 

reporting any incident of what the employee perceives to be harassment, the employee should contact Human 

Resources. If the person toward whom the complaint is directed is one of the individuals indicated above, the 

employee should contact any higher-level manager in the reporting hierarchy. 

**Investigation Procedures** 

Every report of perceived harassment will be fully investigated, and corrective action will be taken where 

appropriate. All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be 

guaranteed. All employees must cooperate with all investigations conducted pursuant to this policy. 

**Retaliation Prohibited** 

In addition, the Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report unwelcome 

conduct to management or who cooperate in the investigations of such reports in accordance with this policy. 

If the employee has been subjected to any such retaliation, the employee should report it in the same manner in 

which the employee would report a claim of perceived harassment under this policy. 

Violation of this policy including any improper retaliatory conduct will result in disciplinary action, up to and 

including termination. 

I have read and I understand Global IP Networks, Inc.'s Non-Harassment Policy.
