# Power Audit Tips & Tricks 

Each Phase has their own sheet at the bottom. ● Cages have a sheet as well at the bottom. ● Cage 2 “Corduro” can not be checked due to needing the code from the customer to open. Most horizontal PDUs displays will be facing the fronts of the cabinets. ● Mainly found in the half cabinets. ● May have to remove a blanking panel on some cabinets to view the displays Some PDUs displays will cycle through the different banks of the PDU or have 2 displays for each bank.. ● We want the total of both banks If a PDU does not have a display, the display is not working, or equipment is blocking the display, put NA for the usage and make a note on the audit. ● List any PDUs with bad or error displays in the "Weekly Power Audit" ticket. If a PDU is found in a cabinet without a label, verify the circuit it is connected to and label the PDU. ● Physically trace the cord of the PDU carefully to the circuit. ● If you can not safely verify the circuit note it on the audit ● Update audit with any changes If you find a customer has moved out of a cabinet update usage and note it in the “Note” field and in the ticket.
