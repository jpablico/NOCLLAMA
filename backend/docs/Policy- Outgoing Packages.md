# Policies and Procedures 

## Outgoing Packages 

## Global IP Networks does not offer package shipping as one of its services. 

 Should a customer request equipment to be packaged and/or shipped, please refer that customer to the facility manager(s), either by transferring the ticket and sending an email or by direct contact if available. Management will then make a determination on whether or not to proceed. Going forward please do not agree to any customer shipping requests. There is no need to reply to the customer with our shipping disclaimer until a determination is made 

 Please respond to customer with something similar to the following; “We have received your request and it has been forwarded to the appropriate personnel, we will update you when we have more information”
