#### This is a period of time where Global IP Networks will not perform internal preventative 

#### maintenance to systems outside the scope of immediate security risks or emergencies. A 

#### notification will be sent out to all affected clients during the month of September each 

#### year. This notification will inform recipients of the details regarding the moratorium 

#### period, which is generally scheduled for 6 8 weeks starting the week of Thanksgiving.

#### period:

#### information for the upcoming moratorium period. 

#### This template will include:

#### delivery
