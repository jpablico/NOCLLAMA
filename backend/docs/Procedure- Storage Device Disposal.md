# Policies and Procedures 

## Storage Device Disposal 

 Customer storage devices should not be immediately disposed of by GIP Networks regardless of customer request. 

 When GIP employees receive a request to destroy or dispose of a customer’s internal HDD, SSD, or any other internal or external storage device the following should be done; 

1. Label drive in question with; company name, date request was made, the ticket number     the request was part of, and the employee’s initials.        If request was made in person or on the phone, please create a ticket to document the request. 

2. Place the labeled drive in the clear storage tub on the customer shelf in the storage     room labeled “End of Life Drives.” 

3. Update customer via ticket, making them aware that;     _For security reasons, we will feed the requested device through our recycle policy. This includes_     _procedures and recycling solutions for end of life technology while securely destroying data and_     _protecting the environment._ 

 We will keep them until we have enough decommissioned equipment to call our electronics end of life recycling partner (vendor). 

 Should this policy not seem adequate for a customer any deviation from this procedure must be approved by Management.
