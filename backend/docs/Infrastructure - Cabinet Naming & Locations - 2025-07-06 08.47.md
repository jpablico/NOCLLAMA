## Cabinet Naming & Locations 

# Introduction 

# Purpose of the Document 

This document serves to standardize cabinet naming, location identification, and ensure adherence to airflow management policies within our datacenter. 

# Cabinet Naming Scheme 

## Naming Convention Overview 

Our data center is divided into three phases: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. Each phase has its distinct naming scheme. **Phase 1** : Consists of Rows A01 through A12. Each row contains a varying number of cabinets. **Phase 2** : Includes Rows A14 through A17 (note there is no Row A13). Like Phase 1, each row has a different number of cabinets. **Phase 3** : Begins with Row B01 and follows a similar pattern with varying cabinet counts per row. The cabinets are named using a combination of the row identifier and the cabinet number in that row. For instance, the third cabinet in Row A01 is labeled as A01-C03. 

### Example Names 

 Phase 1 Example : A01-C03 indicates the third cabinet in Row A01 of Phase 1. Phase 2 Example : A14-C05 denotes the fifth cabinet in Row A14 of Phase 2. Phase 3 Example : B07-C13 represents the thirteenth cabinet in Row B07 of Phase 3.
