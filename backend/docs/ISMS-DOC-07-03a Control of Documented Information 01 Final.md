#### 1.4.2 If you are a member of management 

1. Once a document management request ticket has been created or generated via     the IT Glue workflow (document expirations), an email will be generated to notify     management.        a. A ticket will also be generated in the “Document Management” queue with           the “New” ticket status. 

2. Based on the content of the request, the ticket subject should be modified to     include a brief description of the request using the following template:        a. “Document Management Request | “ _Brief description here’_ ” 

3. The request will undergo a review process:     a. The “Document Status” field should be updated to “Under Review”.     b. The request shall be reviewed for accuracy and feasibility.     c. If a document needs to be drafted or revised as a result of the request, the        initiator or document author must be notified to update the ticket with the        requested information/ documentation.           i. The “Document Status” field should be updated to either “Needing              Revision”, or “Drafting” to reflect what is needed. ii.
