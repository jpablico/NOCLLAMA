# Policies and Procedures 

## Logging Time Spent on Customer Requests 

Please follow the list of steps below to document time spent on customer support. All tasks performed for customers should be noted in the ticket system at https://cp.gipnetworks.com. If the request is in person or over the phone, a ticket must be created documenting the request, what was done and time spent. Please send all hands on requests with the exception of reboots to Controller for review. Please refrain from discussing the amount of time spent or prices with customers. 1) When updating a ticket, the time spent can be added through a feature called Time-Tracking, located on the bottom right side of the Staff followup section (see screenshot below). Alternatively, time can also be added to the ticket system in a comment if you forgot to add it to the client update. ● **Important:** Please use your best judgment when factoring time spent on planning, researching an issue, diagraming, documenting, gathering materials, preparing for a task, etc. *** Time should be recorded in 15 minute increments 2) When a ticket is complete and we do not expect any further response from the customer we can update the customer with the following: **_“We appreciate the opportunity to assist you. As this request has been completed, we will now close this ticket. If you need any further assistance with this matter, simply reply to this email and our system will automatically alert our support team and mark it open.”_** 3) After Updating the client, fill out and post the RRT billing template 4) Once Client has been updated, move the ticket to the Controller Dept.
