## Service Update and Reclaim Tickets 

## Service Update Ticket 

 Billing Creates internal ticket titled "Service Update | Company Name Date & time." o This is billings approval to turn off network only.  Network team shuts off the network only (NOT power).  Two days after the network has been off, turn off power (use timer on ticket).  Move ticket to billing to request authorization to remove equipment (or confiscate if necessary for non-payment).  Begin reclaim process in new ticket linked to existing ticket. The above process is to encourage customer to update their account in the event of non-payment. This process can be skipped by creating a "Reclaim Ticket" directly if the customer is leaving voluntarily.
