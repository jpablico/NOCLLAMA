### Introduction 

This policy will detail how to support clients over the phone. It is important to gather and document as much information as possible in order to ensure the company can properly communicate with and support the needs of all clients. The documentation of phone calls as they happen is essential as verbal communications can be forgotten or improperly replicated if not properly documented. The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document: ISMS-DOC-08-10 CloudKey Support Flow 01 Draft 01 

## 1 Phone support process 

Supporting clients over the phone is an important part of how the organization supports clients. This process details how calls are to be received and documented to achieve client satisfaction and compliance standards. Failure to properly follow this process can result in client requests being completed inaccurately or without proper authorization. This can have a severe impact on business operations and revenue, along with possible legal repercussions. 

### 1.1 Receiving calls 

Phone calls may come in from various sources. These include desktop and VOIP phones connected to the company’s internal PBX and 3CX system as well as cellular phones. Any phone call received from clients involving requests need to be documented in the ticketing system. Callers should be verified accordingly. No action should be taken until the caller can be confirmed as authorized. 

### 1.2 Documenting calls 

The best way to document phone calls is by creating a ticket to record the caller’s information and request details. The following information should be gathered in order to ensure the client can be properly contacted: A. Client name B. Client organization name C. Email address D. Phone number It is important to also document what the client is calling for so that the appropriate assistance can be applied. It is important to be as detailed as possible. Once the ticket has been created it can be processed like any other ticket. If the request requires attention from other departments, those departments should be contacted via email and instant messaging so they can be notified. This notification should include the ticket number for reference.
